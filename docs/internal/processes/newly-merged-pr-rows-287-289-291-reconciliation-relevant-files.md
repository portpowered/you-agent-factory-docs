# Newly Merged PR Rows #287/#289/#291 — Evidence Snapshot

Planner-facing evidence for the
`newly-merged-pr-rows-287-289-291-reconciliation` lane. Captured
2026-07-02 UTC. This lane reconciles stale planner snapshot rows for PRs
already merged into current `origin/main` without editing page content or
reverting user/root work.

Session: `930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864` (model-atlas content lanes;
default factory session omits page lanes)

## `origin/main` identity and root checkout (pre-mutation)

## GitHub PR truth (live, 2026-07-02T20:42Z UTC)

| Work item | PR | State | Merged at (UTC) | Merge commit | Head SHA at merge |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `block-sparse-attention-module-page` | [#287](https://github.com/portpowered/ai-model-reference/pull/287) | MERGED | 2026-07-02T18:58:19Z | `b5716eff` | `f6c0946b` |
| `byte-level-tokenization-page` | [#289](https://github.com/portpowered/ai-model-reference/pull/289) | MERGED | 2026-07-02T18:18:04Z | `2d0b21c4` | `f010c064` |

PR conversation comments (live `gh pr view <n> --json comments`):

| PR | Conversation comments | Latest review signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #287 | present (11 comments) | ends with `CLEARED / PASS review` on head `f6c0946b` (2026-07-02T18:58:12Z UTC) |
| #289 | present (6 comments) | ends with `PASS / non-blocking` on head `f010c064` (2026-07-02T19:12:26Z UTC) |
| #291 | **none** (`comments: []`) | no PR conversation thread; merged PR truth and queue evidence only |

No unresolved BLOCKING/REJECTED/FAIL conversation comments remain on PRs #287 or
#289. PR #291 has no conversation comments, so its **missing-queue-row** no-op
outcome is supported by target-session queue lookups (zero rows) and merged PR
truth on `origin/main`, not by reviewer merge-approval comments.

## Factory queue evidence (session `930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864`)

Command:

```bash
you work list --session 930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864 --name <work-item> --json
```

Default-session lookup (`you work list --name <work-item> --json`) returns empty
for all three named rows.

### `block-sparse-attention-module-page` (PR #287)

Primary content trace (`trace-tokenizer-and-attention-refill-batch-064`):

| Work id | Type | State | Trace |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `batch-tokenizer-and-attention-refill-batch-064-block-sparse-attention-module-page` | idea | `complete` / TERMINAL | `trace-tokenizer-and-attention-refill-batch-064` |
| `work-plan-72` | plan | `complete` / TERMINAL | same |
| `work-review-103` | review | `complete` / TERMINAL | same |
| `work-task-73` | task | `complete` / TERMINAL | same |

Additional stale drain idea (separate trace, not the primary content lane):

| Work id | Type | State | Trace |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `batch-fresh-pr-drain-and-conflict-refresh-batch-073-block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain` | idea | `init` / INITIAL | `trace-fresh-pr-drain-and-conflict-refresh-batch-073` |

Queue completion truth: primary `block-sparse-attention-module-page` trace is
terminal-complete; a separate `block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain` idea
remains at `init` / INITIAL and is not inferred closed from PR #287 merge status
alone.

### `byte-level-tokenization-page` (PR #289)

Primary content trace (`trace-tokenizer-and-attention-refill-batch-064`):

| Work id | Type | State | Trace |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `batch-tokenizer-and-attention-refill-batch-064-byte-level-tokenization-page` | idea | `complete` / TERMINAL | `trace-tokenizer-and-attention-refill-batch-064` |
| `work-plan-69` | plan | `complete` / TERMINAL | same |
| `work-review-105` | review | `complete` / TERMINAL | same |
| `work-task-70` | task | `complete` / TERMINAL | same |

Conflict-refresh / drain trace (`trace-fresh-pr-drain-and-conflict-refresh-batch-073`):

| Work id | Type | State | Trace |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `batch-fresh-pr-drain-and-conflict-refresh-batch-073-byte-level-tokenization-pr289-conflict-refresh` | idea | `complete` / TERMINAL | `trace-fresh-pr-drain-and-conflict-refresh-batch-073` |
| `work-plan-85` | plan | `complete` / TERMINAL | same |
| `work-review-93` | review | `complete` / TERMINAL | same |
| `work-task-86` | task | `complete` / TERMINAL | same |

Queue completion truth: both the primary content trace and the
`byte-level-tokenization-pr289-conflict-refresh` drain trace are
terminal-complete.

### `pr-surface-module-linked-support-records` (PR #291)

`you work list --session 930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864 --name pr-surface-module-linked-support-records --json`
returns **zero results**. Broader substring searches (`pr-surface`,
`module-linked`, `support-records`, `canonical-page-surface-audit`) also return
no queue row whose `name` matches this work item.

Queue completion truth: **no matching queue row** in the target session for this
work item name. PR #291 merge truth is recorded separately; queue closure cannot
be inferred from PR merge status alone.

### This reconciliation lane

| Work id | Type | State | Trace |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `batch-current-main-and-open-pr-convergence-batch-075-newly-merged-pr-rows-287-289-291-reconciliation` | idea | `to-complete` / PROCESSING | `trace-current-main-and-open-pr-convergence-batch-075` |
| `work-task-126` | task | `init` / PROCESSING | same |
| `work-plan-125` | plan | `complete` / TERMINAL | same |

## Merged PR truth vs queue completion truth

| Work item | PR merged on `origin/main` | Primary queue trace terminal | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `block-sparse-attention-module-page` | yes | yes (primary trace) | Separate `block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain` idea at `init` / INITIAL |
| `byte-level-tokenization-page` | yes | yes (primary trace) | Conflict-refresh drain trace also terminal-complete |
| `pr-surface-module-linked-support-records` | yes | n/a (no queue row) | PR merged; target session has no row with this work item name |

Do not infer row closure from PR merge status alone when separate non-terminal
queue tokens exist (for example `block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain` at
`init`) or when no queue row exists for the named work item.

## Lane / worktree metadata

| Work item | Metadata file | PR stamp | Linkage | Refreshed (UTC) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `block-sparse-attention-module-page` | `.claude/worktrees/block-sparse-attention-module-page/.claude/lane-metadata.json` | none | branch `current`, PR `missing` (not refreshed) | 2026-07-02T15:06:04.990Z |
| `byte-level-tokenization-page` | `.claude/worktrees/byte-level-tokenization-page/.claude/lane-metadata.json` | none | branch `current`, PR `missing` (no open PR for merged branch) | 2026-07-02T19:01:27.995Z |
| `pr-surface-module-linked-support-records` | **metadata unavailable** — no worktree directory under `.claude/worktrees/` | n/a | n/a | n/a |

Related subsidiary worktree (conflict-refresh lane for PR #289 context, not the
primary content row):

| Work item | Metadata file | PR stamp | Linkage | Refreshed (UTC) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `byte-level-tokenization-pr289-conflict-refresh` | `.claude/worktrees/byte-level-tokenization-pr289-conflict-refresh/.claude/lane-metadata.json` | #290 | branch `current`, PR `current` | 2026-07-02T18:01:23.310Z |

Content worktrees for the two page lanes exist under
`/Users/abdifamily/work/learn-agent-factories/.claude/worktrees/<work-item>`.
No worktree exists for `pr-surface-module-linked-support-records`; remote branch
`origin/pr-surface-module-linked-support-records` is present.

### Branch drift vs `origin/main` (read-only, 2026-07-02T20:42Z UTC)

Counts are `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...HEAD` (behind|ahead).

| Work item | Local HEAD | Behind main | Ahead of main | Working tree notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `block-sparse-attention-module-page` | `f6c0946b` | 86 | 8 | untracked `progress.txt` |
| `byte-level-tokenization-page` | `f010c064` | 90 | 0 | untracked `progress.txt` |
| `pr-surface-module-linked-support-records` | n/a (no worktree) | n/a | n/a | n/a |

Content worktrees retain post-merge branch heads behind current `origin/main`;
this is expected stale worktree evidence and was not modified during evidence
gathering.

## Quality gate (story 001)

Handoff-only evidence capture; no page content, registry content, root work,
worktree files, queue rows, staging area, or branch history were changed.

```bash
bun run typecheck
```

Result: PASS (2026-07-02T20:42Z UTC).

## Story 002 — per-row outcome classification

Captured 2026-07-02T20:46Z UTC. Classifications use evidence from story 001 plus
fresh read-only queue lookups for subsidiary drain tokens; no queue rows, page
content, registry content, root work, or worktree files were mutated during
classification.

### Classification rules applied

| Outcome | When selected |
| --- | --- |
| **consume** | PR merged on current `origin/main`; row is a stale drain/handoff idea whose purpose is fulfilled; primary implementation and review are already terminal-complete; no active implementation or review would be skipped. |
| **complete** | Row is finished but requires an explicit terminal completion transition (`idea:to-complete` + `task:to-complete` pairing or equivalent valid move). |
| **no-op** | Primary content trace already terminal; unfinished implementation or review; row/PR mismatch; missing queue row; missing evidence; or unsafe root/worktree state. |

### Selected outcome per named row

| Work item | PR | Observed queue state | Observed PR state | Outcome | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `block-sparse-attention-module-page` | #287 | Primary trace `trace-tokenizer-and-attention-refill-batch-064`: idea/plan/review/task all `complete` / TERMINAL; separate `block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain` idea at `init` / INITIAL on trace `trace-fresh-pr-drain-and-conflict-refresh-batch-073` (see subsidiary table) | MERGED (`b5716eff` on `origin/main`) | **no-op** (primary lane) | Primary content lane already terminal-complete with merged PR truth; stale drain idea on a separate trace is classified below and is not inferred closed from PR merge alone. |
| `byte-level-tokenization-page` | #289 | Primary trace `trace-tokenizer-and-attention-refill-batch-064`: all tokens `complete` / TERMINAL; conflict-refresh drain trace `trace-fresh-pr-drain-and-conflict-refresh-batch-073` also terminal-complete | MERGED (`2d0b21c4` on `origin/main`) | **no-op** | Primary content lane and `byte-level-tokenization-pr289-conflict-refresh` drain trace are both terminal-complete; PR merge agrees with queue; no separate stale drain ideas remain at `init` / INITIAL. |
| `pr-surface-module-linked-support-records` | #291 | Zero queue rows in session `930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864` for this work item name; no worktree under `.claude/worktrees/` | MERGED (`5cc5f1a4` on `origin/main`) | **no-op** | **missing-queue-row**: throughput/factory PR merged without a content-lane queue token; queue closure cannot be inferred from PR merge status alone and no consume/complete transition applies to a non-existent row. |

No row received a **complete** classification: none of the three named work items
sit in a non-terminal `to-complete` / PROCESSING pairing that still requires a
valid terminal completion transition.

### `block-sparse-attention-module-page` subsidiary stale token (explicit)

Story 001 required explicit classification of the separate `init` / INITIAL drain
idea returned by `you work list --name block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain`.
This is not the primary content lane but is a stale drain row tied to PR #287.

| Work id | Trace | Observed state | Outcome | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `batch-fresh-pr-drain-and-conflict-refresh-batch-073-block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain` | `trace-fresh-pr-drain-and-conflict-refresh-batch-073` | `init` / INITIAL | **consume** | PR #287 merged on `origin/main`; primary `block-sparse-attention-module-page` implementation and review are terminal-complete; drain idea scoped to green-PR merge/consume handoff is fulfilled and safe to consume without skipping unfinished work. |

### Classification summary

| Outcome | Count | Targets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **no-op** (primary lanes) | 3 | All three named work items — primary traces already terminal or no queue row |
| **consume** | 1 | `block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain` subsidiary stale drain idea |
| **complete** | 0 | — |

Stories 003–005 execute handoffs for the consume, complete, and no-op targets
respectively. This lane (`newly-merged-pr-rows-287-289-291-reconciliation`)
remains in `to-complete` / PROCESSING until those handoffs finish.

## Quality gate (story 002)

Handoff-only classification; no page content, registry content, root work,
worktree files, queue rows, staging area, or branch history were changed.

```bash
bun run typecheck
```

Result: PASS (2026-07-02T20:46Z UTC).

## Story 003 — consume handoff for merged drainable rows

Captured 2026-07-02T20:47Z UTC. Story 002 classified one subsidiary drain idea
as **consume**; this story executes that handoff only. No page content, registry
content, root work, or unrelated worktree files were changed.

### Consume target

| Work item | Work id | PR | Pre-action state | Post-action state | Operation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain` | `batch-fresh-pr-drain-and-conflict-refresh-batch-073-block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain` | #287 | `init` / INITIAL | `complete` / TERMINAL | `you work move` (see below) |

**Evidence that consume is safe**

- PR #287 is MERGED on current `origin/main` (`b5716eff`).
- Primary `block-sparse-attention-module-page` content trace
  (`trace-tokenizer-and-attention-refill-batch-064`) is terminal-complete
  (idea/plan/review/task all `complete` / TERMINAL).
- The drain idea scoped only to green-PR merge/consume handoff; its purpose is
  fulfilled now that PR #287 has landed.
- No active implementation or review tokens would be skipped by closing this
  standalone drain idea.

**Consume operation used**

Standalone drain ideas at `init` / INITIAL with no paired plan/task/review trace
do not enter the `idea:to-complete` + `task:to-complete` → `consume` workstation
pairing. For this row the accepted operator consume action is a direct terminal
move on session `930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864`:

```bash
you work move batch-fresh-pr-drain-and-conflict-refresh-batch-073-block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain complete \
  --session 930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864 --json
```

Result (2026-07-02T20:47Z UTC):

```json
{"workId":"batch-fresh-pr-drain-and-conflict-refresh-batch-073-block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain","previousState":"init","newState":"complete","sessionId":"930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864"}
```

Post-action verification:

```bash
you work show batch-fresh-pr-drain-and-conflict-refresh-batch-073-block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain \
  --session 930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864 --json
```

Observed: `state.name` = `complete`, `state.type` = `TERMINAL`.

### Rows not consumed in story 003

Story 002 selected **no-op** for all three primary content lanes and **complete**
for zero rows. Those handoffs belong to stories 004–005.

## Quality gate (story 003)

Queue consume executed for `block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain` only; no
page content, registry content, root work, worktree files, staging area, or
branch history were changed outside the allowed queue move.

```bash
bun run typecheck
```

Result: PASS (2026-07-02T20:47Z UTC).

## Story 004 — complete handoff for rows needing terminal transition

Captured 2026-07-02T20:48Z UTC. Story 002 classified **zero** rows as **complete**.
This story re-verifies live queue state and documents that no valid terminal
completion transition is required for any named drain row. No page content,
registry content, root work, or unrelated worktree files were changed.

### Complete targets from story 002

| Work item | Work id | PR | Outcome in story 002 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | — | — | **complete** count = 0 |

Story 002 selected **complete** only when a row is finished but still requires an
explicit terminal completion transition (`idea:to-complete` + `task:to-complete`
pairing or equivalent valid move). None of the three primary content traces or
subsidiary drain rows met that criterion.

### Re-verification (2026-07-02T20:48Z UTC)

Fresh `you work list --session 930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864 --name
<work-item> --json` confirms:

| Work item | PR | Observed queue state | Blocker for **complete**? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `block-sparse-attention-module-page` | #287 | All tokens `complete` / TERMINAL | Already terminal — no transition needed |
| `byte-level-tokenization-page` | #289 | All tokens `complete` / TERMINAL | Already terminal — no transition needed |
| `pr-surface-module-linked-support-records` | #291 | Zero queue rows | **missing-queue-row** — no transition applies |

Subsidiary drain token:

| Work id | Observed state | Story 002 outcome | Why not **complete** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `batch-fresh-pr-drain-and-conflict-refresh-batch-073-block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain` | `complete` / TERMINAL (consumed in story 003) | **consume** | Standalone drain idea consumed via direct terminal move, not `to-complete` pairing |

No row sits in a non-terminal `to-complete` / PROCESSING pairing awaiting a
valid terminal completion transition. The reconciliation lane itself
(`newly-merged-pr-rows-287-289-291-reconciliation`) remains in
`to-complete` / PROCESSING until stories 005–006 finish; that lane is out of
scope for the three named PR drain rows.

### Completion operations executed

None. Zero rows qualified for **complete**; no manual queue movement was
performed in story 004.

## Quality gate (story 004)

Handoff-only verification; no page content, registry content, root work,
worktree files, queue rows, staging area, or branch history were changed.

```bash
bun run typecheck
```

Result: PASS (2026-07-02T20:48Z UTC).

## Story 005 — no-op handoffs for unsafe or already-settled rows

Captured 2026-07-02T20:50Z UTC. Story 002 classified three primary content lanes as
**no-op**. This story documents explicit no-op handoffs only; no page content,
registry content, root work, worktree files, or queue rows were changed.

### No-op reason categories

| Category | Meaning in this reconciliation |
| --- | --- |
| **already-terminal** | Primary content trace idea/plan/review/task all `complete` / TERMINAL |
| **unfinished-implementation** | Active handoff scope still requires operator work before any queue move |
| **unfinished-review** | Review token still active or blocked |
| **row/PR mismatch** | Row scope does not match the merged-PR drain target |
| **missing-queue-row** | Target session has no queue row for the named work item |
| **missing-metadata** | Required lane/worktree metadata unavailable |
| **inaccessible PR truth** | GitHub PR state could not be verified |
| **unsafe root/worktree** | Move would require reverting, cleaning, or staging root/worktree state |

### Primary lane no-op handoffs (three named PR rows)

Re-verified with `you work list --session 930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864
--name <work-item> --json` on 2026-07-02T20:50Z UTC.

| Work item | PR | Observed queue state | Observed PR state | No-op reason | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `block-sparse-attention-module-page` | #287 | Primary trace `trace-tokenizer-and-attention-refill-batch-064`: idea/plan/review/task all `complete` / TERMINAL | MERGED (`b5716eff` on `origin/main`) | **already-terminal** | Primary content lane finished implementation and review before PR merge; subsidiary `block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain` was consumed in story 003 and is now `complete` / TERMINAL; moving the primary lane would be redundant queue churn. |
| `byte-level-tokenization-page` | #289 | Primary trace `trace-tokenizer-and-attention-refill-batch-064`: all tokens `complete` / TERMINAL; conflict-refresh drain trace `trace-fresh-pr-drain-and-conflict-refresh-batch-073` also terminal-complete | MERGED (`2d0b21c4` on `origin/main`) | **already-terminal** | Primary content lane and `byte-level-tokenization-pr289-conflict-refresh` drain trace are both settled; PR merge agrees with queue completion truth; no separate stale drain ideas remain at `init` / INITIAL. |
| `pr-surface-module-linked-support-records` | #291 | Zero queue rows in session `930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864` for this work item name; no worktree under `.claude/worktrees/` | MERGED (`5cc5f1a4` on `origin/main`) | **missing-queue-row** | Throughput/factory PR merged without a content-lane queue token; queue closure cannot be inferred from PR merge status alone and no consume/complete transition applies to a non-existent row. |

**Operations executed for primary lanes:** none. All three rows left untouched.

### Next safe owner actions

| Work item | No-op reason | Next safe owner action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `block-sparse-attention-module-page` | **already-terminal** | None required for queue movement; content is on `origin/main` via PR #287. Stale worktree branch drift (86 behind main) is read-only evidence and was not cleaned. |
| `byte-level-tokenization-page` | **already-terminal** | None required for queue movement; content is on `origin/main` via PR #289. Stale worktree branch drift (90 behind main) is read-only evidence and was not cleaned. |
| `pr-surface-module-linked-support-records` | **missing-queue-row** | Do not infer queue closure from PR #291 merge alone. If planner tracking is needed, create a dedicated throughput/factory lane with explicit scope rather than retroactively completing a non-existent content row. |

No row in this reconciliation required a **unfinished-implementation**,
**unfinished-review**, **row/PR mismatch**, **missing-metadata**,
**inaccessible PR truth**, or **unsafe root/worktree** no-op reason.

### Rows not covered by story 005 no-op

| Work item | Story 002 outcome | Handled in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain` | **consume** | Story 003 — moved to `complete` / TERMINAL |
| — | **complete** (zero rows) | Story 004 — no transitions required |

### No-op summary

| No-op reason | Count | Targets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **already-terminal** | 2 | `block-sparse-attention-module-page`, `byte-level-tokenization-page` |
| **missing-queue-row** | 1 | `pr-surface-module-linked-support-records` |
| **unfinished-implementation** | 0 | — |
| **unfinished-review** | 0 | — |
| **row/PR mismatch** | 0 | — |
| **missing-metadata** | 0 | — |
| **inaccessible PR truth** | 0 | — |
| **unsafe root/worktree** | 0 | — |

## Quality gate (story 005)

Handoff-only no-op documentation; no page content, registry content, root work,
worktree files, queue rows, staging area, or branch history were changed.

```bash
bun run typecheck
```

## Story 006 — final root and content safety verification

Captured 2026-07-02T21:15Z UTC. This story verifies that reconciliation changed
only allowed queue state (story 003 consume) or handoff notes (stories 001–002,
004–005). No page content, registry content, generated content, root user work,
or unrelated worktree files were edited, reverted, staged, or cleaned.

### Root checkout after reconciliation

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Root repo path | `/Users/abdifamily/work/learn-agent-factories` |
| Root branch | `main` |
| Root HEAD | `a502405d49badc50b8b3c0ea49cd8d35a402738e` (matches `origin/main`) |
| Root dirty paths | 0 |
| Pre-existing dirty state | none — root remained clean throughout reconciliation |

Root checkout status is unchanged from story 001 pre-mutation evidence.

### Content and worktree safety

Branch diff vs `origin/main` is limited to handoff documentation only:

```bash
git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-only
```

Observed (2026-07-02T21:15Z UTC):

- `docs/internal/processes/newly-merged-pr-rows-287-289-291-reconciliation-relevant-files.md`

No page content (`src/content/**`), registry content, generated runtime
artifacts committed to the branch, or unrelated worktree files were modified.

Content worktree pre-existing drift (read-only, untouched):

| Work item | Working tree notes |
| --- | --- |
| `block-sparse-attention-module-page` | untracked `progress.txt`; branch 86 behind `origin/main` |
| `byte-level-tokenization-page` | untracked `progress.txt`; branch 90 behind `origin/main` |
| `pr-surface-module-linked-support-records` | no worktree directory |

These paths were present before reconciliation and were not reverted, staged,
deleted, or cleaned during stories 001–006.

### Queue transition record

One queue transition occurred during reconciliation (story 003):

| Work id | Work item | Before | After | Story |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `batch-fresh-pr-drain-and-conflict-refresh-batch-073-block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain` | `block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain` | `init` / INITIAL | `complete` / TERMINAL | 003 |

Post-reconciliation verification (2026-07-02T21:15Z UTC):

```bash
you work show batch-fresh-pr-drain-and-conflict-refresh-batch-073-block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain \
  --session 930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864 --json
```

Observed: `state.name` = `complete`, `state.type` = `TERMINAL`.

### Rows left untouched

All other named drain rows received handoff-only outcomes with no queue move:

| Target | Outcome | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `block-sparse-attention-module-page` | no-op | already-terminal |
| `byte-level-tokenization-page` | no-op | already-terminal |
| `pr-surface-module-linked-support-records` | no-op | missing-queue-row |

### Planner verification commands

```bash
bun run report:planner-queue-health
```

Result: PASS (2026-07-02T20:51:36Z UTC). Default-session summary reports
`active=4 blocked=0 repairable=0 noise=6`; none of the three merged PR drain
rows appear as active blocked lanes because primary content traces are
terminal-complete and the `block-sparse-attention-pr287-clean-drain` consume
closed the subsidiary drain idea.

## Quality gate (story 006)

Final verification; branch history contains only handoff documentation plus the
single allowed queue consume from story 003.

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun run test
```

Typecheck: PASS (2026-07-02T21:14Z UTC).

Tests: PASS — 3597 pass, 0 fail across 533 files (2026-07-02T21:35Z UTC).
