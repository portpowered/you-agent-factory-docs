# Factory Linkage Relevant Files

Use these files when changing queue/worktree/PR linkage classification,
watchdog summaries, or planner-facing linkage reports.

## Core classification and discovery

* `src/lib/factory/repo-path-resolution.ts` — resolve main repository root and
  default `.claude/worktrees` directory from nested git worktree checkouts via
  `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`; planner watchdog and linkage scripts should
  use these helpers instead of `join(import.meta.dir, "..")` when discovering
  lane worktrees from factory worktrees.
* `src/lib/factory/queue-worktree-pr-linkage-ledger.ts` — shared lane
  discovery, linkage status, noise partitioning, and summary formatters.
* `src/lib/factory/active-pr-mergeability-watchdog.ts` — PR lookup, branch
  candidate resolution, drift/mergeability classification for active lanes.
* `src/lib/factory/planner-batch-collision-preflight.ts` — consumes linkage
  ledger data and should scope actionable gap reporting through shared helpers.
* `src/lib/factory/planner-worktree-drift-watchdog.ts` — root vs active
  worktree drift classification, including already-merged root drift and
  ownerless root dirty path recovery guidance.
* `src/lib/factory/planner-root-checkout-reconciliation.ts` — non-destructive
  root checkout reconciliation that compares dirty paths against `HEAD` and
  `origin/main`, classifies remote-present local deletions as ownerless root
  checkout drift with `present-on-origin-main` evidence, groups
  tokenizer-mismatch remote-present deletions under
  `tokenizer-mismatch-remote-present-deletions` with stale root checkout drift
  guidance, keeps other dirty paths in manual-inspection groups with
  per-change-kind counts, nests modified shared paths under
  `manual-inspection-shared-edits` with preserve guidance, names generated
  table-registry drift under `generated-table-registry-drift` with
  `generated-artifact` and `table-registry-associated-runtime` families plus
  validation/regeneration guidance, names conflict-drift PRs under
  `conflict-drift-prs` with branch-refresh guidance and optional metadata-refresh
  guidance when linkage refresh is required, and prints operator next actions
  (page-refill hold or resume, merge-conflict priority guidance, safe cleanup
  path for remote-present deletions, generated drift and conflict-drift counts,
  manual ownership inspection) with target session
  `0fdc5077-95ed-4396-a183-06e5b16555ca`.
* `src/lib/factory/planner-latent-diffusion-root-deletion-reconciliation.ts` —
  read-only landed-evidence verification for the latent diffusion paper page
  repair lane: confirms PR #264 / merge `3ea842f` in `origin/main` lineage,
  checks page bundle, registry, citation, graph, and focused-test surfaces on
  `origin/main`, records root-checkout dirty paths separately from shipped
  main evidence, inspects completed `latent-diffusion-paper-page`
  worktree/branch path evidence against `origin/main`, classifies every
  reconciliation dirty path by ownership/intent, and emits root reconciliation
  outcomes for safe stale-drift restore vs operator handoff plus content-lane
  hold/release decisions. See
  [latent-diffusion-root-deletion-reconciliation-relevant-files](./latent-diffusion-root-deletion-reconciliation-relevant-files.md).
* `src/lib/factory/ownerless-generated-table-registry-drift.ts` — read-only
  evidence capture for the ownerless generated table registry drift priority
  blocker: records root `HEAD`, `origin/main`, ahead/behind relationship,
  scoped dirty status for
  `src/lib/content/generated/table-registry.generated.ts`, and
  `looped-transformers-comparison.json` import/source-list/payload observation.
  See
  [ownerless-generated-table-registry-drift-relevant-files](./ownerless-generated-table-registry-drift-relevant-files.md).
* `src/lib/factory/planner-merged-lane-evidence.ts` — terminal-complete and
  merged-branch evidence used to attribute stale root drift to merged page lanes.
* `src/lib/factory/terminal-lane-main-branch-landing-audit.ts` — read-only
  terminal or near-terminal lane candidate discovery for main-branch landing
  audits; reuse `parseTerminalCompleteWorkItems` / queue TERMINAL evidence and
  worktree metadata instead of duplicating lane parsing. Surface comparison uses
  `git cat-file -e <main-ref>:<path>` for main evidence and
  `parsePlannerRelevantDirtyPaths` for planner-root drift, keeping those signals
  separate. Expected surfaces accept explicit per-lane fixtures or derive from
  branch diff filtered to page-bundle, registry-record, and focused-test paths.
  Landing-status classification consumes `TerminalLaneLandingSurfaceComparison`
  plus optional candidate terminal-state evidence to emit
  `landed` / `remote-only` / `partial` / `reconciliation-required` with cited
  surface reasons. Full planner report output is assembled by
  `collectTerminalLaneMainBranchLandingAuditReport` with grouped human-readable
  and JSON serializers plus recommended planner actions. Mismatch regression
  tests should exercise the full collect pipeline with fixture git status and
  assert page-bundle, registry-record, and focused-test surface names in both
  human-readable and JSON report output.

## Planner-facing commands

| When | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Diagnose mergeability class, linkage gaps, and action queue for active PR-backed lanes | `bun run watch:active-pr-mergeability` |
| Inspect queue/worktree/PR linkage ledger with optional metadata refresh | `bun run report:queue-worktree-pr-linkage-ledger` |
| Planner batch dispatch: collision preflight before scheduling overlapping lanes | `bun run report:planner-batch-collision-preflight` |
| Planner worktree drift against active lanes | `bun run report:planner-worktree-drift-watchdog` |
| Terminal or near-terminal lane landing audit against main | `bun run report:terminal-lane-main-branch-landing-audit` |
| Root checkout reconciliation against HEAD and origin/main | `bun run report:planner-root-checkout-reconciliation` |
| Latent diffusion root deletion landed-evidence verification | `bun run report:planner-latent-diffusion-root-deletion-reconciliation` |
| Ownerless generated table registry drift evidence capture | `bun run report:ownerless-generated-table-registry-drift` |
| Merged PR drain row evidence for PRs #281/#282/#284/#286 | `bun run report:merged-pr-drain-rows-reconciliation` |
| Planner concurrency floor: useful active lanes, refill guidance, and hold/stale classifications | `bun run report:planner-concurrency-floor` |

Direct script paths remain supported for fixture-driven tests:

* `bun ./scripts/active-pr-mergeability-watchdog.ts`
* `bun ./scripts/report-queue-worktree-pr-linkage-ledger.ts`
* `bun ./scripts/report-terminal-lane-main-branch-landing-audit.ts`
* `bun ./scripts/report-planner-root-checkout-reconciliation.ts`
* `bun ./scripts/report-planner-latent-diffusion-root-deletion-reconciliation.ts`
* `bun ./scripts/report-merged-pr-drain-rows-reconciliation.ts`
* `bun ./scripts/report-planner-concurrency-floor.ts`

Concurrency-floor report contract details:
[planner-concurrency-floor-signal-reconciliation-relevant-files](./planner-concurrency-floor-signal-reconciliation-relevant-files.md).

## Classification contract

* `already-merged-owned` — root drift matches dirty paths or shared surfaces
  from a terminal-complete or merged-into-main page lane; report includes PR and
  merge-commit evidence when available.
* `ownerless-root-dirty-paths` — root dirty paths with no active or merged lane
  owner; report includes preserve-policy guidance, `investigate-and-preserve`
  next action, and target session `0fdc5077-95ed-4396-a183-06e5b16555ca` in
  recovery examples.
* `pr-backed` — lane has resolved `pullRequest` evidence from live lookup,
  branch candidates, or current stamped lane metadata. Passing checks report
  `mergeability=mergeable` even when GitHub `mergeStateStatus` is `BLOCKED`.
  Stale stamped linkage surfaces as `metadata-refresh=` hints, separate from
  `risk=metadata-unavailable` (reserved for missing PR/check evidence).
* `actionable-gaps` — active/failed task or review lanes missing repairable
  worktree, branch, or PR metadata.
* `queue-only-noise` — expected queue-only missing worktree rows and stale
  failed `thoughts` loopbacks; compacted into `Noise Summary` rows.
* `stale-clean-pr-mismatch` — open PR with `mergeability=mergeable` and
  `checks=passing` while the queue token is `failed`; surfaced as
  `lane-kind=stale-clean-pr-mismatch` with `mismatch-reason=` evidence in the
  active PR watchdog and linkage ledger `Stale PR Mismatch Summary` section,
  not counted as active page implementation depth.
* Conflict-priority ordering for PR-backed actionable rows uses
  `sortPlannerWatchdogLanes`: `conflict-drift` / `merge-conflict` first, then
  failing checks, then pending/wait checks, then other PR-backed lanes; gap and
  noise lanes sort after PR-backed rows. Watchdog and ledger scripts share the
  same sorter via `partitionLinkageLanesForSummary`.

Reuse `isQueueOnlyMissingLinkageLane`, `isStaleFailedLoopbackLane`,
`isStaleCleanPrMismatchLane`, `isActionableLinkageGapLane`, and
`partitionLinkageLanesForSummary` instead of duplicating filters in scripts or
planner preflight.

## Fixture inputs for tests

Linkage script tests should prefer observable command output over source
inventory checks. Supported fixture flags:

* `--work-list-json`
* `--session-list-json`
* `--worktrees-dir`
* `--pr-map-json`
* `--status-output` for root checkout reconciliation fixture status porcelain
  (`mixed-dirty-status.txt`, `tokenizer-mismatch-dirty-status.txt`,
  `manual-inspection-shared-edits-dirty-status.txt`,
  `table-registry-drift-dirty-status.txt`)
* `--session` for live `you work list` discovery in integration-style tests

Story 004 end-to-end fixture verification uses the shared representative
fixture in `linkage-classifier-report-compatibility.test.ts` (PR-backed
conflict-drift lane, actionable gap, stale loopback noise, and queue-only
missing-linkage noise) plus per-script discovery tests under
`src/tests/discovery/active-pr-mergeability-watchdog.test.ts` and
`src/tests/discovery/queue-worktree-pr-linkage-ledger.test.ts`. Ledger rows
surface stale stamped linkage in `metadata-refresh=` separately from primary
`missing=` reasons.

Representative regression coverage lives in
`src/tests/discovery/linkage-classifier-report-compatibility.test.ts`,
`src/tests/discovery/tokens-per-second-stale-pr-follow-up-compatibility.test.ts`
(PR #251 stale-clean mismatch fixture for watchdog action queue and ledger
`Stale PR Mismatch Summary`),
`src/tests/discovery/planner-root-drift-pr-metadata-repair-compatibility.test.ts`
(already-merged root drift, ownerless recovery guidance, and PR-backed metadata
refresh with passing checks), and
`src/tests/discovery/planner-root-checkout-reconciliation.test.ts` with fixture
status output under `src/tests/fixtures/planner-root-checkout-reconciliation/`.
