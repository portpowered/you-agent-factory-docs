# Search Domain Relevant Files

Use these files when changing search document construction, AI enrichment,
Orama indexing, or `/api/search` behavior.

## Core search boundary

* `src/lib/search/build-base-document.ts`
  Generic base search document construction from localized docs pages and
  registry fields. Produces page-derived fields with empty topology and
  kind/tag facets only.
* `src/lib/search/enrich-search-document.ts`
  Generic enrichment step that resolves published classification lineage, topology
  relationship terms, and legacy taxonomy compatibility onto base documents.
* `src/lib/search/model-atlas-ai-search-enrichment-adapter.ts`
  Model Atlas AI enrichment adapter that appends model/module facets
  (`modelFamily`, `sourceType`, `modalities`, `trainingRegimeIds`, `optimizes`)
  onto generic search documents. Registered by the search builder in story 003.
* `src/lib/search/build-documents.ts`
  Model Atlas search builder: composes base documents with generic
  `enrichSearchDocument`, then applies `enrichSearchDocumentWithModelAtlasAiFacets`
  before returning catalog `SearchDocument` records consumed by `search-server.ts`.
* `src/lib/search/to-advanced-index.ts`
  Projects `SearchDocument` records into Fumadocs advanced search indexes.
* `src/lib/search/search-server.ts`
  Localized search catalog, `/api/search` query handling, classification scope,
  and reranking.
* `src/app/api/search/route.ts`
  Public search API route; re-exports `docsSearchApi.GET`.

## Parity and regression tests

* `src/tests/search/search-behavior-parity.test.ts`
  Focused baseline for attention, GQA alias, tag, and classification-scoped
  search before/after the generic base + AI enrichment boundary split. Extend
  this file when adding new parity assertions for the enrichment refactor.
* `src/tests/search/search-api-contract-parity.test.ts`
  `/api/search` bootstrap export and query contract parity for GQA, attention,
  tag-filtered, and classification-scoped searches after the boundary split.
* `src/lib/search/to-advanced-index.test.ts`
  Fumadocs advanced index projection contract for `id`, `title`, `description`,
  `url`, `structuredData`, and `tag` fields.
* `src/lib/search/build-base-document.test.ts`
  Generic base document field contract and empty topology/facet guarantees.
* `src/tests/fixtures/non-ai-shell/search.test.ts`
  Non-AI fixture base and generic-enrichment search document fields and Orama
  query behavior without AI registry enrichment; uses
  `buildNonAiShellFixtureBaseSearchDocuments()` and
  `buildNonAiShellFixtureSearchDocuments()` (shared enrichment only, no AI adapter).
* `src/tests/fixtures/non-ai-shell/fixture.ts`
  Non-AI shell fixture pages and search builders; `buildNonAiShellFixtureSearchDocuments`
  composes base documents with `enrichSearchDocuments` for the generic search proof.
* `src/lib/search/enrich-search-document.test.ts`
  Generic enrichment topology/facet contract, searchable topology terms, and draft or
  missing-target stability coverage.
* `src/lib/search/model-atlas-ai-search-enrichment-adapter.test.ts`
  Model Atlas AI facet adapter contract for model/module records, generic facet
  preservation, and non-model/module no-op behavior.
* `src/tests/search/build-documents.test.ts`
  Document construction and topology normalization coverage.
* `src/tests/search/search-api.test.ts`
  `/api/search` HTTP contract and `docsSearchApi` ranking regressions.
* `src/tests/search/helpers.ts`
  Shared search test URLs and result assertion helpers.
