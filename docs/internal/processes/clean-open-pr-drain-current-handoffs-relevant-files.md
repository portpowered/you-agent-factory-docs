# Clean Open PR Drain — Current Handoffs — Evidence Snapshot

Planner-facing evidence for the `clean-open-pr-drain-current-handoffs` lane.
Captured 2026-07-02T20:47Z UTC. This lane drains or hands off currently clean
open PRs (#290, #273, #271, #268, #251) and records already-consumed PR #294
without duplicating content generation or broad repair work.

Session: `930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864` (model-atlas content lanes;
default factory session `0c392c83-a136-48be-a2ad-efa42151f448` omits page lanes;
documented session `0fdc5077-95ed-4396-a183-06e5b16555ca` returns 404 in this
environment)

PR #289 (`byte-level-tokenization-page`) **merged** 2026-07-02T18:18:04Z. PR #290
remains open on the handoff branch with merge conflicts vs current `main`
(`baseRefOid=d22d1e0d`, behind current `origin/main` at `a502405d`).

**Row status:** handoff lane queue TERMINAL-complete; open PR #290 is **stale
conflict-drift** relative to post-#289/post-#298 `main`. Content ownership sits
with merged PR #289 — do not regenerate byte-level tokenization page content.

Lane metadata: PR #290 stamped `current` on handoff worktree
`byte-level-tokenization-pr289-conflict-refresh`.

### PR #273 — `tokens-per-second-pr251-merge-handoff`

**Factory queue row:** none in sessions `930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864` or
`0c392c83-a136-48be-a2ad-efa42151f448` (`you work list --name
tokens-per-second-pr251-merge-handoff --json` returns empty).

Handoff worktree PRD (`tokens-per-second-pr251-merge-handoff/prd.json`): all
stories `passes: true`. Lane metadata PR linkage `missing` (not refreshed).

**Row status:** queue-absent / worktree-complete — open PR #273 is
CONFLICTING/DIRTY vs `main` (`baseRefOid=05852b8d`, stale base). Recovery target
is PR #251 content branch per handoff lane story 002; not a new tokens-per-second
content implementation lane.

Evidence artifact:
`docs/internal/processes/tokens-per-second-pr251-merge-handoff-relevant-files.md`
(sibling worktree).

### PR #271 — `relative-position-bias-concept-page`

**Factory queue row:** none in either live session (`you work list --name
relative-position-bias-concept-page --json` returns empty).

Content worktree PRD: all four page stories `passes: true`. Lane metadata PR
linkage `missing` (GitHub resolves branch → PR #271).

**Row status:** queue-absent / worktree-complete — open PR #271 is MERGEABLE/CLEAN
with all CI checks SUCCESS. Head `956bacb2`; drift vs `origin/main` is
behind=184/ahead=5 (content branch needs rebase or operator merge timing).

PR conversation: mergeability follow-up posted 2026-07-02T06:30Z UTC; no
BLOCKING/REJECTED/FAIL markers on latest comments.

### PR #268 — `terminal-audit-root-staged-deletion-handoff`

**Factory queue row:** none in either live session.

Handoff worktree PRD: all stories `passes: true`. Lane metadata: PR #268 stamped
`current`.

**Row status:** queue-absent / worktree-complete — open PR #268 is MERGEABLE/CLEAN
with all CI checks SUCCESS. Prior BLOCKING review (package.json in diff, dirty-root
allowlist) addressed in PR conversation 2026-07-02 UTC with scope-guard fixes.

Evidence artifact:
`docs/internal/processes/terminal-audit-root-staged-deletion-handoff-evidence.md`
(sibling worktree). Root dirty-path ownership boundaries remain outside this drain
lane.

### PR #251 — `tokens-per-second-serving-metric-page`

**Factory queue row (documented, session unavailable):**

| Work id | Type | State | Trace |

Session `0fdc5077-95ed-4396-a183-06e5b16555ca` returns 404 (`factory session not
found`). Prior capture in
[tokens-per-second-stale-pr-follow-up-relevant-files](./tokens-per-second-stale-pr-follow-up-relevant-files.md).

Content worktree lane metadata: PR #251 stamped `current`. Drift vs `origin/main`:
behind=303/ahead=10.

**Row status:** queue-stale vs clean PR — PR #251 is MERGEABLE/CLEAN with passing
CI, but documented queue carries `idea:to-complete` + `task:failed`. PR
conversation still has unresolved **BLOCKING** review feedback (canonical-page-surface
over-budget on `prose-auto-link-runtime.ts`; incomplete browser QA). Do not merge
or regenerate tokens-per-second content from this drain lane.

## Scope boundary (unchanged)

This drain lane must not:

- create duplicate byte-level tokenization, relative position bias, or
  tokens-per-second content pages while PRs #289/#271/#251 remain owners,
- reopen or duplicate the merged generic PR #277/#279 conflict-refresh handoff,
- clean, revert, stage, or mutate unrelated root dirty paths for terminal-audit
  ownership,
- perform broad planner, factory, route, search, registry, or root-cleanup refactors.

Evidence capture for story 001 was read-only: no branch mutation, queue movement,
staging, committing content edits, or destructive git operations occurred while
gathering this snapshot.

## Quality gate (story 001)

```bash
bun run typecheck
```

Result: PASS (2026-07-02T20:47Z UTC).

## Story 002 — per-PR convergence classification

Captured 2026-07-02T21:00Z UTC. Classifications use story 001 evidence only; no
queue rows, page content, registry content, root work, worktree files, or branch
history were mutated during classification.

### Classification rules applied

| Outcome | When selected |
| --- | --- |
| **already-consumed** | GitHub or `origin/main` ancestry proves the PR is merged or the change is already represented on current main; queue handoff purpose is fulfilled. |
| **merge-ready-handoff** | PR is open, non-draft, checks are terminal SUCCESS (or explicitly pending final operator confirmation), GitHub reports MERGEABLE/CLEAN, no duplicate active lane owns different content for the same surface, and no unresolved BLOCKING conversation feedback remains on the PR head. |
| **review-consume-handoff** | PR is clean enough for maintainer review and queue consumption, but operator merge or final review is outside this drain lane's authority and merge-ready criteria are not fully met (for example behind-main drift without operator rebase timing). |
| **blocked-owner-handoff** | Merge or consume is not currently safe; names the exact blocker, owning row or worktree, and next operator action. |
| **duplicate-or-stale** | A newer merged PR, remote-main representation, or terminal-complete handoff lane supersedes the open PR; cites exact evidence rather than queue drift alone. |

### Selected outcome per target PR

| PR | Work item | Observed PR state | Observed queue / row state | Outcome | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [#294](https://github.com/portpowered/ai-model-reference/pull/294) | `generic-pr277-pr279-conflict-refresh-handoff` | **MERGED** (`209d1bd8` on `origin/main`) | batch-073 idea/plan/review/task all `complete` / TERMINAL | **already-consumed** | Merge commit is an ancestor of current `origin/main` (`a502405d`); lane metadata stamps PR #294 `current`; batch 066 drain ideas retain ownership for underlying PR #277/#279 shells — do not reopen this handoff. |

| [#273](https://github.com/portpowered/ai-model-reference/pull/273) | `tokens-per-second-pr251-merge-handoff` | OPEN **CONFLICTING** / DIRTY; CI SUCCESS on head `9a2bf86e` | queue-absent; handoff worktree PRD all `passes: true` | **blocked-owner-handoff** | **Blocker:** stale base (`baseRefOid=05852b8d`) vs current `origin/main` (`a502405d`); GitHub merge state DIRTY. **Owner:** `tokens-per-second-pr251-merge-handoff` worktree (lane metadata PR linkage `missing`). **Next action:** conflict refresh on the existing handoff branch to recover PR #251 merge path — not a new tokens-per-second content lane. |
| [#271](https://github.com/portpowered/ai-model-reference/pull/271) | `relative-position-bias-concept-page` | OPEN **MERGEABLE** / CLEAN; all 11 CI checks SUCCESS on head `956bacb2` | queue-absent; content worktree PRD all stories `passes: true` | **merge-ready-handoff** | No duplicate active lane owns relative-position-bias content; declared canonical-page-surface exception documented in PR conversation 2026-07-02T06:15Z UTC; mergeability follow-up merged `origin/main` 2026-07-02T06:30Z UTC with no later BLOCKING comments. **Operator action:** maintainer review and merge (or timed rebase if behind-main drift grows). |
| [#268](https://github.com/portpowered/ai-model-reference/pull/268) | `terminal-audit-root-staged-deletion-handoff` | OPEN **MERGEABLE** / CLEAN; all 11 CI checks SUCCESS on head `d6afe796` | queue-absent; handoff worktree PRD all `passes: true` | **merge-ready-handoff** | Prior BLOCKING review (package.json in diff, dirty-root allowlist) addressed in PR conversation with mapped fixes and `bun test` validation; no newer BLOCKING conversation comments. **Operator action:** maintainer review and merge; root dirty-path ownership stays outside this drain lane. |
| [#251](https://github.com/portpowered/ai-model-reference/pull/251) | `tokens-per-second-serving-metric-page` | OPEN **MERGEABLE** / CLEAN; all 11 CI checks SUCCESS on head `381abe9a` | batch-039 `idea:to-complete` + `task:failed` (session 404); lane metadata PR #251 `current` | **blocked-owner-handoff** | **Blocker:** unresolved **BLOCKING** PR conversation review — shared `prose-auto-link-runtime.ts` edit breaks page-local surface budget (`audit:canonical-page-surface` over-budget) and browser QA incomplete. **Owner:** `tokens-per-second-serving-metric-page` content lane / `work-task-155`. **Next action:** keep slice page-local or move shared auto-link work to throughput/conflict-reduction lane; rerun audit and browser QA; related recovery lane PR #273. Do not merge or regenerate content from this drain lane. |

No target PR received **review-consume-handoff** in this classification pass:
#271 and #268 meet merge-ready criteria (MERGEABLE/CLEAN, terminal green CI, no
unresolved BLOCKING feedback). #290 and #273 are not review-clean; #294 is
consumed; #251 remains review-blocked.

### Classification summary

Stories 003–004 executed handoffs for merge-ready, blocked, and duplicate/stale
targets. Story 005 emits the final planner drain report below. This lane
(`clean-open-pr-drain-current-handoffs`) remains in `to-complete` / PROCESSING
until the drain PR merges and the planner consumes the row.

### Duplicate-content guard (classification boundary)

| Surface | Owning PR / lane | Drain-lane action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Byte-level tokenization page | PR #289 merged | Do not regenerate; #290 is stale handoff only |
| Relative position bias concept | PR #271 open | Hand off for merge; no new concept lane |
| Tokens per second glossary | PR #251 open (blocked) | No new content lane; recovery via #273 handoff |
| Generic PR #277/#279 conflict refresh | PR #294 merged | Already consumed; batch 066 retains shell ownership |
| Terminal-audit root staged deletion | PR #268 open | Hand off for merge; no root cleanup from drain lane |

## Quality gate (story 002)

Handoff-only classification; no page content, registry content, root work,
worktree files, queue rows, staging area, or branch history were changed.

```bash
bun run typecheck
```

Result: PASS (2026-07-02T21:05Z UTC).

## Story 003 — clean content PR handoffs (#290, #271, #251)

Captured 2026-07-02T21:10Z UTC. This story documents operator handoffs for the
three content PRs targeted by the drain lane. No page content, registry content,
root work, worktree files, queue rows, staging area, or branch history were
mutated. No branch refresh was attempted from this drain lane.

**Duplicate-content guard (reconfirmed):** Do not generate new byte-level
tokenization, relative position bias, or tokens-per-second pages while PR #289

**Operator action:** Maintainer review and merge PR #271. Optional timed rebase
if behind-main drift grows; do not open a duplicate relative-position-bias concept
lane.

**No new content:** The relative-position-bias concept page is owned by PR #271
and its worktree; this drain lane must not regenerate that page.

**Browser verification (2026-07-02T21:07Z UTC):** Production build from owner
worktree head `956bacb2` on port 3744 — `curl --max-time 10
http://127.0.0.1:3744/docs/concepts/relative-position-bias` returned HTTP 200

**Operator action:** Close PR #290 or operator-refresh the handoff branch for
queue bookkeeping only — **not** for content regeneration. Batch-064 content lane
(`byte-level-tokenization-page`, PR #289 merged) owns the page.

**No new content:** Byte-level tokenization page content must not be regenerated
from this drain lane or from PR #290.

**Browser verification (2026-07-02T21:00Z UTC):** Production build from root
`origin/main` (`a502405d`) on port 3743 — `curl --max-time 10
http://127.0.0.1:3743/docs/modules/byte-level-tokenization` returned HTTP 200
with title `Byte-Level Tokenization` confirming consumed content is live on main.

### PR #251 — `tokens-per-second-serving-metric-page` (blocked-owner-handoff)

Live evidence does **not** support merge-ready or review-consume handoff. Latest
PR conversation comment (2026-07-02T03:31:22Z UTC, head `381abe9a`) contains
**BLOCKING** review: shared `prose-auto-link-runtime.ts` edit
(`SYSTEM_ALIAS_AMBIGUITY_CANDIDATES` for bare `throughput`) violates page-local
surface budget; browser QA incomplete on current head.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Existing row | batch-039 `idea:to-complete` + `work-task-155:failed` (session 404) |
| Content surface | `/docs/glossary/tokens-per-second` (`concept.tokens-per-second`) |
| Head branch | `tokens-per-second-serving-metric-page` @ `381abe9a` |
| Current `origin/main` | `a502405d` |
| Merge state | MERGEABLE / CLEAN (GitHub) |
| CI on head | 11/11 SUCCESS |
| Blocker | Unresolved **BLOCKING** PR conversation on head `381abe9a` — shared runtime in `prose-auto-link-runtime.ts`; redirect-to-throughput-prd per audit |
| Owner | `tokens-per-second-serving-metric-page` content lane / `work-task-155` |
| Related recovery | PR [#273](https://github.com/portpowered/ai-model-reference/pull/273) (`tokens-per-second-pr251-merge-handoff`, CONFLICTING/DIRTY) |

**Operator action:** Content lane must keep the branch page-local (remove shared
`prose-auto-link-runtime.ts` changes or move throughput alias work to the
throughput/conflict-reduction lane), rerun
`audit:canonical-page-surface -- --page-dir src/content/docs/glossary/tokens-per-second`
to `within-budget`, complete browser QA, then re-review. Do **not** merge or
regenerate tokens-per-second content from this drain lane.

**No new content:** Tokens-per-second glossary page remains owned by PR #251;
recovery merge path stays with PR #273 handoff lane (story 004).

**Browser verification:** Not rerun on blocked head from this drain lane — prior
addressing comments document within-budget audit on earlier heads but latest
BLOCKING (2026-07-02T03:31:22Z) supersedes merge readiness. Operator must
re-verify after page-local fix lands on PR #251.

### Branch refresh actions (story 003)

| PR | Refresh attempted? | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #271 | no | Mergeability follow-up already merged `origin/main` on owner branch |
| #290 | no | duplicate-or-stale — content consumed; handoff branch close/refresh is operator bookkeeping only |
| #251 | no | blocked-owner — refresh would not clear BLOCKING shared-surface feedback |

### Quality gate (story 003)

Handoff-only documentation; no page content, registry content, root work,
worktree files, queue rows, staging area, or branch history were changed.

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun run test
```

Result: typecheck PASS (2026-07-02T21:08Z UTC); full test suite PASS — 3615 pass / 0 fail (2026-07-02T21:27Z UTC).

## Story 004 — non-content repair PR handoffs (#273, #268, #294)

Captured 2026-07-02T22:05Z UTC. This story documents operator handoffs for the
three non-content repair PRs targeted by the drain lane. No page content,
registry content, root work, worktree files, queue rows, staging area, or branch
history were mutated. No branch refresh, root cleanup, or broad factory refactor
was attempted from this drain lane.

### `origin/main` identity (refreshed)

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `origin/main` SHA | `9fa3fa8bed8febb6795d3001366b98bbc7b81fdf` |
| Commit date | 2026-07-02 14:28:22 -0700 |
| Subject | Merge pull request #301 from portpowered/root-main-lag-and-current-truth-reconciliation |

PR #294 merge commit `209d1bd8ced0cced5fd99992fe50f23296d126e8` remains an
ancestor of current `origin/main`.

### Non-content handoff summary

| PR | Work item | Story 002 outcome | Story 004 handoff type | Live evidence supports handoff? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [#273](https://github.com/portpowered/ai-model-reference/pull/273) | `tokens-per-second-pr251-merge-handoff` | blocked-owner-handoff | **blocked-owner-handoff** (merge/queue recovery) | yes — conflict drift; recovery lane complete |
| [#268](https://github.com/portpowered/ai-model-reference/pull/268) | `terminal-audit-root-staged-deletion-handoff` | merge-ready-handoff | **merge-ready-handoff** | yes — MERGEABLE/CLEAN, BLOCKING addressed |
| [#294](https://github.com/portpowered/ai-model-reference/pull/294) | `generic-pr277-pr279-conflict-refresh-handoff` | already-consumed | **already-consumed** | yes — merged on `main` |

**Scope guard (reconfirmed):** This drain lane must not start a new
tokens-per-second content implementation lane, clean or mutate unrelated root
dirty paths, reopen the merged generic PR #277/#279 conflict-refresh handoff, or
introduce broad planner, factory, route, search, registry, or root-cleanup work.

### PR #273 — `tokens-per-second-pr251-merge-handoff` (blocked-owner-handoff)

Handled as a **tokens-per-second PR #251 merge/queue recovery handoff**, not as a
new tokens-per-second content implementation lane. The merge-handoff worktree
PRD is complete (all stories `passes: true`); PR conversation documents story
004 non-page scope preservation on head `9a2bf86e`.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Existing row | queue-absent; handoff worktree PRD all stories `passes: true` |
| Recovery target | PR [#251](https://github.com/portpowered/ai-model-reference/pull/251) (`tokens-per-second-serving-metric-page`, blocked on unresolved BLOCKING review) |
| Head branch | `tokens-per-second-pr251-merge-handoff` @ `9a2bf86e` |
| Current `origin/main` | `9fa3fa8b` |
| Merge state | CONFLICTING / DIRTY (`baseRefOid=05852b8d`, stale vs current main) |
| CI on handoff head | 11/11 SUCCESS (stale base) |
| Blocker | GitHub merge state DIRTY — conflict refresh required on existing handoff branch before operator can advance PR #251 recovery |
| Owner | `tokens-per-second-pr251-merge-handoff` worktree (lane metadata PR linkage `missing`) |
| Evidence artifact | `docs/internal/processes/tokens-per-second-pr251-merge-handoff-relevant-files.md` (sibling worktree) |

**Operator action:** Conflict refresh on branch `tokens-per-second-pr251-merge-handoff`
only — preserves the lane's 3-path allowlist (handoff docs, factory-linkage cross-ref,
fixture-backed scope test). Recovery action remains **safe branch refresh on content
branch `tokens-per-second-serving-metric-page`** after PR #251 clears BLOCKING review
(shared `prose-auto-link-runtime.ts` surface budget). Do **not** regenerate
tokens-per-second page content from this drain lane.

**No new content:** Tokens-per-second glossary page remains owned by PR #251;
this handoff lane records queue/merge recovery evidence only.

**Root dirty paths:** Not touched from this drain lane. Root reconciliation and
dirty-path ownership stay with terminal-audit and operator-hold lanes.

### PR #268 — `terminal-audit-root-staged-deletion-handoff` (merge-ready-handoff)

Handled as a **terminal-audit/root-staged-deletion handoff** with dirty-root
ownership boundaries preserved. Prior BLOCKING review (`package.json` in diff,
dirty-root allowlist) was addressed in PR conversation with mapped fixes: removed
`package.json` mutation, removed dirty-root touch allowlist, scope guard fails on
any of the six PRD dirty root paths. No newer BLOCKING/REJECTED/FAIL conversation
comments follow the addressing reply.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Existing row | queue-absent; handoff worktree PRD all stories `passes: true` |
| Repair surface | Read-only terminal-audit root staged deletion evidence (`planner-terminal-audit-root-staged-deletion-handoff` report) |
| Head branch | `terminal-audit-root-staged-deletion-handoff` @ `d6afe796` |
| Current `origin/main` | `9fa3fa8b` |
| Merge state | MERGEABLE / CLEAN |
| CI (2026-07-02T05:30:14Z UTC head) | 11/11 SUCCESS |
| PR conversation | BLOCKING addressed with scope-guard fixes; no later BLOCKING markers |
| Evidence artifact | `docs/internal/processes/terminal-audit-root-staged-deletion-handoff-evidence.md` (sibling worktree) |

**Operator action:** Maintainer review and merge PR #268. Root dirty-path
ownership (`package.json`, terminal-audit deletions, and the other four PRD dirty
paths) remains **outside** this drain lane — do not clean, revert, stage, or
unstage unrelated root paths from here.

**No root cleanup:** This drain lane did not reconcile, restore, or mutate any of
the six dirty root paths on the planner root checkout.

**Browser verification:** N/A — handoff lane emits planner evidence only; no
customer-facing docs route changes.

### PR #294 — `generic-pr277-pr279-conflict-refresh-handoff` (already-consumed)

Marked **already consumed** — merged evidence remains current on `origin/main`.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Existing row | batch-073 idea/plan/review/task all `complete` / TERMINAL |
| State | **MERGED** 2026-07-02T19:04:52Z at merge commit `209d1bd8` |

| Current `origin/main` | `9fa3fa8b` (includes #294 merge ancestry) |
| Underlying shell PRs | batch 066 drain ideas (`generic-search-ai-enrichment-pr277-drain`, `generic-site-config-pr279-drain`) retain ownership for PR #277/#279 |

**Operator action:** Consume batch-073 queue row if not already done. Do **not**
reopen or duplicate the generic PR #277/#279 conflict-refresh handoff. Any
remaining PR #277/#279 coordination stays with batch 066 drain lanes per
[generic-pr277-pr279-conflict-refresh-handoff-relevant-files](./generic-pr277-pr279-conflict-refresh-handoff-relevant-files.md).

**No duplicate handoff:** Generic conflict-refresh purpose is fulfilled; this
drain lane records consumption only.

### Branch refresh actions (story 004)

| PR | Refresh attempted? | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #273 | no | blocked-owner — conflict refresh belongs to owner handoff worktree, not this drain lane |
| #268 | no | merge-ready — no drain-lane refresh required; operator merge |
| #294 | no | already-consumed — merged |

### Broad-cleanup guard (story 004)

| Prohibited action | Status |
| --- | --- |
| New tokens-per-second content lane | not started |
| Root dirty-path cleanup / restore | not performed |
| Generic PR #277/#279 handoff duplication | not performed |
| Broad planner/factory/route/search/registry refactor | not introduced |
| Page content, registry, or navigation edits | not performed |

### Quality gate (story 004)

Handoff-only documentation; no page content, registry content, root work,
worktree files, queue rows, staging area, or branch history were changed.

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun run test
```

Result: typecheck PASS (2026-07-02T22:06Z UTC); full test suite PASS — 3615 pass / 0 fail (2026-07-02T21:53Z UTC).

## Story 005 — final planner drain report and quality evidence

Captured 2026-07-02T22:55Z UTC. This story emits the consolidated planner-facing
