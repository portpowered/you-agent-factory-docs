# Ownerless Generated Table Registry Drift — Relevant Files

Use these files when changing the narrow ownerless generated table registry
drift evidence lane. This lane is read-only: it must not mutate
`src/lib/content/generated/table-registry.generated.ts` or unrelated generated
artifacts.

## Target artifact

The evidence lane focuses on exactly one generated artifact:

* `src/lib/content/generated/table-registry.generated.ts`

The observed table entry under investigation is
`looped-transformers-comparison.json` (`table.looped-transformers-comparison`).

## Core evidence module

* `src/lib/factory/ownerless-generated-table-registry-drift.ts` — read-only
  evidence capture for root `HEAD`, `origin/main`, ahead/behind relationship,
  scoped dirty status for the generated artifact, and
  `looped-transformers-comparison.json` import/source-list/payload observation
  from HEAD, worktree, and scoped diff excerpts. Resolves the main repo root
  from nested worktrees via `resolveMainRepoRoot`. Git subprocesses use
  `createIsolatedGitProcessEnv` so inherited `GIT_DIR` / `GIT_WORK_TREE`
  values from nested worktrees do not redirect fixture-repo evidence capture.
  Classification helpers
  (`classifyGeneratedTableRegistryArtifactStatus`,
  `buildTableRegistryRegenerationProof`) emit exactly one primary status
  (`classifyGeneratedTableRegistryArtifactStatus`,
  `buildTableRegistryRegenerationProof`) emit exactly one primary status
  (`expected`, `stale`, `owned`, `ownerless`) backed by deterministic table
  registry regeneration proof and optional drift-snapshot lane ownership.
  Next-action helpers (`resolveGeneratedTableRegistryArtifactNextAction`,
  `buildOwnerlessGeneratedTableRegistryDriftPlannerReport`) emit one explicit
  planner next action per classified status. Consolidated planner report
  formatting (`formatOwnerlessGeneratedTableRegistryDriftPlannerReport`)
  surfaces artifact path, observed table id, primary status,
  `classification-clarity` (`clear` or `ambiguous` for ownerless drift),
  `evidence-summary`, and `next-safe-action` in one planner-facing section.
* `scripts/report-ownerless-generated-table-registry-drift.ts` — planner-facing
  CLI with fixture flags aligned to other factory reports. Default output
  includes evidence, classification, and next action; pass `--evidence-only` to
  retain the story-001 evidence surface.

## Planner-facing command

| When | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Capture read-only generated table registry drift evidence for the ownerless priority blocker | `bun run report:ownerless-generated-table-registry-drift` |

Default output includes evidence, artifact classification, and one explicit
planner next action. The consolidated `[planner-report]` section names artifact
path, observed table id, primary status, evidence summary, classification
clarity, and next safe action. Use `--evidence-only` when a caller needs the
story-001 evidence surface only.

Fixture flags:

* `--repo-root`
* `--remote-base-ref`
* `--status-output`
* `--diff-output`
* `--json` or `--format json`
* `--evidence-only`

## Fixture-backed verification

When report or evidence logic changes, add or extend fixture-backed tests under
`src/lib/factory/ownerless-generated-table-registry-drift.test.ts` using
fixtures in
`src/tests/fixtures/ownerless-generated-table-registry-drift/`. Tests should
assert observable emitted behavior (root git truth, artifact dirty status,
table-entry observation kind, preserve policy, primary classification status,
regeneration proof kind, lane ownership when present, consolidated planner
report fields (`evidence-summary`, `classification-clarity`), and
next-safe-action for each primary status) without meta inventories of routes,
docs links, or command lists.
