# Derived page validation — relevant files

## Contract implementation

- `src/lib/content/validate-derived-published-page-bundles.ts` — scanner-backed derived validation for ordinary published page bundles (frontmatter, default-locale messages, route metadata, registry alignment, tags, citations, local assets).
- `src/lib/content/validate-derived-published-page-bundles.test.ts` — focused fixture tests for the derived contract, including failure cases.
- `src/lib/content/validate-registry.ts` — `validateRegistryContent` calls `validateDerivedPublishedPageBundles` after registry and per-page MDX validation.

## Failure proof

The `derived published-page bundle contract failure proof` describe block in
`validate-derived-published-page-bundles.test.ts` proves observable diagnostics
for standard page-bundle relationships without scanning full site inventories:

| Relationship | Error code |
| --- | --- |
| Unresolved `registryId` | `unresolved-registry-id` |
| Missing default-locale messages | `missing-default-locale-messages` |
| Unresolved frontmatter tag | `unresolved-tag` |
| Unresolved declared citation | `unresolved-citation` |
| Missing local asset message key | `missing-asset-message-key` |

A companion test proves `validateRegistryContent` (the `make validate-data` path)
surfaces derived failures for published pages.

## Policy (contributors and factory executors)

Ordinary content-only published page bundles are covered by derived
published-page validation. Do **not** add a new per-page test for an ordinary
page unless it introduces new rendering behavior, a new component contract, or
a focused regression guard.

Derived coverage is process-focused. It does not require agents to maintain broad
route inventories, docs link topology inventories, or asset-bundle internals
unless those surfaces are the product behavior under test.

## Validation evidence

Run these commands for touched content and validation infrastructure:

| When | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Ordinary page bundle or registry record edits | `make validate-data` |
| Internal docs links after content shape is stable | `make linkcheck` |
| Changes to the derived contract module or its fixtures | `bun test src/lib/content/validate-derived-published-page-bundles.test.ts` |
| Pre-PR full gate (includes derived coverage via `validate-data`) | `make ci` |
| Narrow content-branch proof before review | `bun run doctor:content-pr` |

Focused doctor behavior tests live in `src/tests/ci/content-pr-doctor.test.ts`.
They inject `runCommand` and `verifyRuntimeCompleteness` to assert stage order,
failure stages, drifted paths, and repair guidance without running real git or
generation.

`make validate-data` is the primary evidence that ordinary page bundles satisfy
the derived contract. Prefer it over adding shared per-page tests that only
duplicate registry, message, tag, citation, or local-asset checks.

## When derived coverage is enough

Ordinary content-only published pages should **not** add new per-page tests that only re-check:

- `registryId` resolution and page-kind alignment
- default-locale `messages/en.json`
- declared frontmatter tags
- registry-backed `citationIds`
- local `assets.json` message-key wiring

Use `make validate-data` or `validateDerivedPublishedPageBundles` for that evidence instead.

## When to keep per-page tests

Retain or add per-page tests only for special behavior:

- rendered HTML / component contracts
- search and discovery wiring for representative queries
- related-doc navigation graphs
- graph/table asset registry runtime (`validateColocatedPageBundle` table/graph refs)
- page-generation workflow validation (`validateGeneratedPageBundle`)
- focused regression guards that cannot be expressed as derived bundle invariants

Fence retained tests with a file- or describe-level comment explaining why the coverage is special.
