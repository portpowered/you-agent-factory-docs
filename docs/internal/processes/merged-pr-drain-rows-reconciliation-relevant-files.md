# Merged PR Drain Rows Reconciliation — Evidence Snapshot

Planner-facing read-only evidence for reconciling stale queue drain rows whose
PRs are already merged into current `origin/main`: PR #281 (`ltx-23`), PR #282
(`MAMBA`), PR #284 (`glossary-decomposition`), and PR #286 (`bpe-page`).

Session: `930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864` (model-atlas content lanes).
Documented session `0fdc5077-95ed-4396-a183-06e5b16555ca` returns 404 in this
environment.

## Origin/main and root checkout (2026-07-02 UTC)

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `origin/main` SHA | `209d1bd8ced0cced5fd99992fe50f23296d126e8` |
| Root repo path | `/Users/abdifamily/work/learn-agent-factories` |
| Root dirty paths | `0` at capture time |

## Live evidence command

```bash
bun run report:merged-pr-drain-rows-reconciliation
```

Text output includes evidence plus per-row `consume` / `complete` / `no-op`
classification, consume handoff commands, complete handoff details, no-op
handoff evidence, and final verification (root checkout before/after,
baseline-aware content safety, queue transition summary). JSON output (`--json` or `--format json`) serializes the full
reconciliation output including evidence, classification, consume, complete,
no-op, and final verification reports. Pass `--execute-consume`
to run accepted manual drain-row consume moves through
`you work move <drain-work-id> complete --session <session>`. Pass
`--execute-complete` to run accepted terminal-completion moves for rows classified
as `complete`.

Fixture-backed unit tests:

```bash
bun test src/lib/factory/merged-pr-drain-rows-reconciliation.test.ts
```

## Classification outcomes (2026-07-02 UTC)

| Work item | PR | Outcome | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ltx-23` | #281 | `consume` | PR merged into `origin/main`; content lane terminal-complete; drain row `ltx-23-pr281-drain` remains `init/INITIAL`. |
| `MAMBA` | #282 | `consume` | PR merged into `origin/main`; content lane terminal-complete; drain row `mamba-pr282-drain` remains `init/INITIAL`. |
| `glossary-decomposition` | #284 | `consume` | PR merged into `origin/main`; content lane terminal-complete; drain row `glossary-decomposition-pr284-conflict-refresh` remains `init/INITIAL`. |
| `bpe-page` | #286 | `no-op` | No dedicated drain row; content lane already terminal-complete (`already-settled`). |

## Consume handoffs (2026-07-02 UTC)

Accepted consume operation for stale merged drain rows:
`manual-drain-row-move-to-complete` via
`you work move <drain-work-id> complete --session 930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864`.

The standard factory `consume` workstation (`idea:to-complete` + `task:to-complete`
with the same name) does not apply to standalone drain idea rows.

| Work item | Drain row | Work ID | Pre-consume state | Post-consume state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ltx-23` | `ltx-23-pr281-drain` | `batch-pr281-and-remote-truth-reconciliation-batch-068-ltx-23-pr281-drain` | `init/INITIAL` | `complete/TERMINAL` |
| `MAMBA` | `mamba-pr282-drain` | `batch-clean-pr-drain-and-idea-backlog-batch-070-mamba-pr282-drain` | `init/INITIAL` | `complete/TERMINAL` |
| `glossary-decomposition` | `glossary-decomposition-pr284-conflict-refresh` | `batch-conflict-drift-and-root-dirty-handoff-batch-071-glossary-decomposition-pr284-conflict-refresh` | `init/INITIAL` | `complete/TERMINAL` |

Classification is derived from queue + PR evidence. Worktree metadata augments
evidence but is not required when queue tokens and PR truth are sufficient.

## Complete handoffs (2026-07-02 UTC)

Accepted complete operation for non-terminal drain rows that still need a valid
terminal transition: `manual-drain-row-terminal-completion` via
`you work move <drain-work-id> complete --session 930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864`.

| Work item | PR | Outcome | Complete handoff |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ltx-23` | #281 | `no-op` (`already-terminal`) | none — drain row already `complete/TERMINAL` after consume |
| `MAMBA` | #282 | `no-op` (`already-terminal`) | none — drain row already `complete/TERMINAL` after consume |
| `glossary-decomposition` | #284 | `no-op` (`already-terminal`) | none — drain row already `complete/TERMINAL` after consume |
| `bpe-page` | #286 | `no-op` (`already-settled`) | none — no dedicated drain row |

Live queue state has zero rows classified as `complete`; all three drain rows were
consumed in story 003 and now classify as `already-terminal`.

## No-op handoffs (2026-07-02 UTC)

For every row classified as `no-op`, the report emits an explicit no-op handoff
with `row-left-untouched=true`, the exact `no-op-reason`, observed queue/PR state,
and optional `missing-evidence` or `next-safe-owner-action` fields when applicable.

| Work item | PR | Outcome | No-op reason | Owner action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ltx-23` | #281 | `no-op` | `already-terminal` | none — drain row already `complete/TERMINAL` after consume |
| `MAMBA` | #282 | `no-op` | `already-terminal` | none — drain row already `complete/TERMINAL` after consume |
| `glossary-decomposition` | #284 | `no-op` | `already-terminal` | none — drain row already `complete/TERMINAL` after consume |
| `bpe-page` | #286 | `no-op` | `already-settled` | none — no dedicated drain row |

No-op reasons distinguish `already-terminal` and `already-settled` from unfinished
implementation/review, row/PR mismatch, missing metadata, inaccessible PR truth,
missing queue evidence, and unsafe root checkout. Rows with unfinished work name
the next safe owner action instead of implying completion.

## Merged PR truth vs queue completion truth

All four PRs report `state=MERGED` with merge commits present in `origin/main`
lineage. Content lanes (`ltx-23`, `MAMBA`, `glossary-decomposition`,
`bpe-page`) are `complete/terminal` across idea, plan, task, and review tokens.

Drain rows remain non-terminal:

| Work item | Drain row | Queue state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ltx-23` | `ltx-23-pr281-drain` | `init` / INITIAL |
| `MAMBA` | `mamba-pr282-drain` | `init` / INITIAL |
| `glossary-decomposition` | `glossary-decomposition-pr284-conflict-refresh` | `init` / INITIAL |
| `bpe-page` | _(none)_ | no dedicated drain row |

Merged PR status alone does not close drain rows; queue completion truth is
recorded separately in the report `merged-vs-queue-truth` field per row.

## Core module and script

* `src/lib/factory/merged-pr-drain-rows-reconciliation.ts` — read-only evidence
  capture for the four named rows: queue tokens, GitHub PR truth via
  `gh pr view`, worktree lane metadata, `origin/main` identity, main-repo root
  checkout dirty-path count and baseline snapshots, explicit merged-vs-queue truth distinction,
  per-row `consume` / `complete` / `no-op` classification, consume handoff
  builders/executors for `manual-drain-row-move-to-complete`, complete handoff
  builders/executors for `manual-drain-row-terminal-completion`, no-op handoff
  builders for unsafe or already-settled rows, and final verification for
  root/content safety plus queue transition summaries.
* `scripts/report-merged-pr-drain-rows-reconciliation.ts` — planner-facing CLI.
  Resolves main-repo worktrees via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` so reports
  work from nested git worktrees.

## Fixture flags

* `--work-list-json`
* `--worktrees-dir`
* `--session`
* `--remote-base-ref`
* `--repo-root`
* `--execute-consume`
* `--execute-complete`
* `--json` / `--format json`

## Scope guardrails

This lane gathers evidence and classification only. It does not edit page
content, registry content, queue rows, worktree files, or root checkout state.

Final verification records post-reconciliation root checkout, compares dirty-path
baselines captured during evidence gathering, and emits queue transition summaries
for executed consume/complete moves or explicit `left-untouched` no-op rows.
