# Generic PR #277 / PR #279 Conflict Refresh Handoff — Evidence Snapshot

Planner-facing evidence for the `generic-pr277-pr279-conflict-refresh-handoff`
lane. Captured 2026-07-02 UTC. This lane decides whether PR #277 and PR #279
should be refreshed in their owned worktrees, handed off to the existing batch
066 drain items, or blocked — without duplicating drain work or broadening generic
shell scope.

Session: `930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864` (model-atlas content lanes;
default factory session omits generic-shell page lanes)

## Original work item intent

| PR | Work item | Intent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #277 | `generic-search-ai-enrichment-plugin` | Move AI-specific search facet enrichment behind a Model Atlas-owned adapter while keeping generic topology/base enrichment in shared search code. Shared enrichment must not import AI record types for model/module facets; AI facets (`modelFamily`, `sourceType`, `modalities`, `trainingRegimeIds`, `optimizes`) remain on current Model Atlas records via the builder adapter. |
| #279 | `generic-site-config-neutral-surfaces` | Make the shared `SiteConfig` contract domain-neutral (string route surface ids, arbitrary collection placeholders, generic home featured-link copy) while preserving `modelAtlasSiteConfig` and current header/home behavior. |

Both original worktree PRDs mark all implementation stories `passes: true`. Queue
tokens for the original lanes remain `idea:to-complete` with `task:failed` on
trace `trace-generic-shell-hardening-batch-002` because open PRs are blocked on
merge conflicts and review-loop quality gates, not incomplete implementation
stories.

## Batch 066 drain ownership (no duplicate drain work)

Batch 066 (`trace-green-pr-drain-and-conflict-triage-batch-066`) already owns
dedicated drain ideas for both PRs. This batch 073 handoff lane must not create
competing drain lanes.

| Work id | Type | State | Trace | Intended ownership |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `batch-green-pr-drain-and-conflict-triage-batch-066-generic-search-ai-enrichment-pr277-drain` | idea | `init` / INITIAL | `trace-green-pr-drain-and-conflict-triage-batch-066` | Inspect PR #277 queue tokens, lane metadata, and worktree state; complete review/consume, merge/hand off the green PR, or document the exact blocker. |
| `batch-green-pr-drain-and-conflict-triage-batch-066-generic-site-config-pr279-drain` | idea | `init` / INITIAL | `trace-green-pr-drain-and-conflict-triage-batch-066` | Inspect PR #279 queue tokens, lane metadata, and worktree state; complete review/consume, merge/hand off the green PR, or document the exact blocker. |

Command used:

```bash
you work list --session 930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864 \
  --name generic-search-ai-enrichment-pr277-drain --json
you work list --session 930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864 \
  --name generic-site-config-pr279-drain --json
```

Default-session lookup (`you work list --name … --json`) returns empty for all
four generic lane names. Documented session `0fdc5077-95ed-4396-a183-06e5b16555ca`
returns 404 (`factory session not found`) in this environment.

This lane (`batch-fresh-pr-drain-and-conflict-refresh-batch-073`) is a separate
planner handoff on trace `trace-fresh-pr-drain-and-conflict-refresh-batch-073`
with `idea:to-complete` and `work-task-91` at `task:init`. It gathers evidence
and selects recovery outcomes; it does not replace the batch 066 drain ideas.

test-integration, validate-data, linkcheck, ci).

Latest PR conversation feedback (blocking unless superseded):

1. **BLOCKING MERGE** (2026-07-02T14:59:47Z): review clear and CI green on head
   `6a1530a0`, but `gh pr merge 277 --merge` failed — GitHub cannot create a
   clean merge commit. Suggested repair: merge or rebase `origin/main`, resolve
   conflicts, push, rerun checks.
2. **REVIEW CLEAR** (2026-07-02T14:56:54Z): supersedes earlier `make test`
   timeout blockers; local `make test` 3411 pass / 0 fail on `6a1530a0`.

All required CI checks on PR #279 report SUCCESS (same 11-check CI matrix as
#277).

Latest PR conversation feedback (blocking unless superseded):

1. **BLOCKING** (2026-07-02T13:12:04Z): local `make test` failed — one a11y
   search-page-panel smoke test timed out at 15s on head `e5defbc8`. GitHub CI
   and mergeability were CLEAN at the time of that comment; live inspection now
   reports DIRTY/CONFLICTING again.
2. Earlier merge-conflict and `make test` blockers were addressed in commits
   `95dd6861` and `e5defbc8` per follow-up comments; the latest blocking comment
   supersedes cleared merge-conflict feedback with a new local-gate failure.

## Branch drift vs `origin/main` (non-mutating)

| Branch | Ahead | Behind | Merge base |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `origin/generic-search-ai-enrichment-plugin` | 8 | 58 | `798a0c7bd709d2a38037eecd6a01323507810e1b` |
| `origin/generic-site-config-neutral-surfaces` | 6 | 70 | `9136cb1ef90e1eb5942cf811b7310191c8a5ea93` |

Non-mutating `git merge-tree` conflict paths (changed in both):

**PR #277**

- `src/lib/content/time-to-first-token-discovery.test.tsx`
- `src/tests/search/search-api.test.ts`
- `src/tests/search/search-page-panel.test.tsx`

**PR #279**

- `src/tests/search/search-page-panel.test.tsx`

Both PR branches also carry lane-owned file deltas outside the conflict set (for
example PR #277 search enrichment adapter files; PR #279 site-config contract
files). Story 002 classifies refresh safety and collision risk from this drift
evidence.

## Related active generic-shell worktrees (collision context)

Present under `.claude/worktrees/` and potentially overlapping search, sidebar,
route, or site-config surfaces:

- `generic-search-ai-enrichment-plugin` (PR #277 owner)
- `generic-site-config-neutral-surfaces` (PR #279 owner)
- `generic-search-domain-enrichment-boundary`
- `generic-sidebar-ai-adapter-extraction`
- `generic-sidebar-collection-builder`
- `generic-browse-sections-from-collections`
- `generic-message-boundary-adapter`
- `generic-pr277-pr279-conflict-refresh-handoff` (this lane; evidence only in
  story 001)

Story 002 completed formal collision preflight below; no branch refresh was
attempted in this lane.

## Branch drift and collision classification (story 002)

Captured 2026-07-02T18:10Z UTC. Read-only `git fetch` plus `git merge-tree` and
`git rev-list` only; no branch mutation, queue movement, or content edits outside
this evidence document.

### Drift summary vs `origin/main` (`d22d1e0`)

| Branch | Ahead | Behind | Merge base |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `origin/generic-search-ai-enrichment-plugin` | 8 | 58 | `798a0c7bd709d2a38037eecd6a01323507810e1b` |
| `origin/generic-site-config-neutral-surfaces` | 6 | 70 | `9136cb1ef90e1eb5942cf811b7310191c8a5ea93` |

Both branches remain far behind `origin/main` with open PRs reporting
`mergeable: CONFLICTING` and `mergeStateStatus: DIRTY` while all 11 required CI
checks report SUCCESS.

### Conflict paths (`git merge-tree`, changed in both)

**PR #277 — `generic-search-ai-enrichment-plugin`**

| Path | In lane-owned delta? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/lib/content/time-to-first-token-discovery.test.tsx` | yes | content discovery test; main and lane both touched |
| `src/tests/search/search-api.test.ts` | yes | search API contract test aligned with enrichment adapter |
| `src/tests/search/search-page-panel.test.tsx` | yes | **shared** with PR #279 conflict set |

**PR #279 — `generic-site-config-neutral-surfaces`**

| Path | In lane-owned delta? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/tests/search/search-page-panel.test.tsx` | yes | **only** conflict path; core site-config contract files merge cleanly |

Lane-owned deltas outside the conflict set remain intact (PR #277:
`enrich-search-document.ts`, `model-atlas-ai-search-enrichment-adapter.ts`, and
related search tests; PR #279: `site-config.contract.ts`,
`model-atlas-site-config.ts`, header/nav tests).

### Active generic worktree collision preflight

| Worktree | Queue state (session `930b51a6…`) | Overlap risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `generic-search-ai-enrichment-plugin` | `idea:to-complete` + `task:failed` on trace `trace-generic-shell-hardening-batch-002` | PR #277 owner — not a third-party collision |
| `generic-site-config-neutral-surfaces` | `idea:to-complete` + `task:failed` on trace `trace-generic-shell-hardening-batch-002` | PR #279 owner — not a third-party collision |
| `generic-sidebar-ai-adapter-extraction` | `idea:complete` / TERMINAL on trace `trace-generic-shell-hardening-batch-002` | sidebar surface; no active in-flight work |
| `generic-search-domain-enrichment-boundary` | no queue token in session | worktree present; no scheduled overlap |
| `generic-sidebar-collection-builder` | no queue token in session | worktree present; no scheduled overlap |
| `generic-browse-sections-from-collections` | no queue token in session | worktree present; no scheduled overlap |
| `generic-message-boundary-adapter` | no queue token in session | worktree present; no scheduled overlap |
| `generic-pr277-pr279-conflict-refresh-handoff` | `idea:to-complete` / `task:init` on trace `trace-fresh-pr-drain-and-conflict-refresh-batch-073` | evidence/handoff lane only |

No third-party generic lane is actively mutating search, sidebar, route, or
site-config surfaces in parallel. The collision risk is **cross-PR shared
surface** (`search-page-panel.test.tsx`) plus **batch 066 drain ownership**, not
an unrelated active lane.

### Batch 066 drain duplication check

| Drain idea | State | Trace |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `generic-search-ai-enrichment-pr277-drain` | `idea:init` / INITIAL | `trace-green-pr-drain-and-conflict-triage-batch-066` |
| `generic-site-config-pr279-drain` | `idea:init` / INITIAL | `trace-green-pr-drain-and-conflict-triage-batch-066` |

Refreshing either PR branch from this batch 073 handoff lane would duplicate the
existing batch 066 drain items that already own review/consume, merge, and
branch-refresh completion for PR #277 and PR #279.

### Selected outcome per PR (story 002)

| PR | Classification | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #277 | **handoff-to-batch-066** | Conflicts span shared search test surfaces including `search-page-panel.test.tsx` (also conflicted on #279). Batch 066 `generic-search-ai-enrichment-pr277-drain` already owns refresh/merge completion. Refresh here would duplicate drain work and require coordinated judgment on the shared test file. |
| #279 | **handoff-to-batch-066** | Sole conflict is `search-page-panel.test.tsx`, outside core site-config contract files. Requires cross-surface judgment with PR #277 on the same test file. Batch 066 `generic-site-config-pr279-drain` owns completion. Latest PR conversation still has unresolved **BLOCKING** local `make test` a11y timeout on head `e5defbc8` (no later clearing comment). |

Neither PR is **refresh-safe** under story 002 rules: batch 066 drain ownership
prevents non-duplicative refresh from this lane, and the shared
`search-page-panel.test.tsx` conflict requires owner judgment across PRs.

Story 003 (in-lane refresh) does **not** run for either target. Story 004
(handoff to batch 066) is the selected path for both PRs.

## Story 003 — in-lane refresh outcome (N/A)

Captured 2026-07-02T19:05Z UTC. Story 003 runs only when story 002 selects
**refresh-safe** for a target PR. Story 002 classified both PR #277 and PR
#279 as **handoff-to-batch-066**, so no in-lane branch refresh was attempted in
this batch 073 handoff lane.

### Precondition check

| PR | Story 002 classification | Story 003 runs? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #277 | handoff-to-batch-066 | no |
| #279 | handoff-to-batch-066 | no |

### Actions not taken (by design)

- No merge or rebase of `origin/main` into
  `generic-search-ai-enrichment-plugin` or `generic-site-config-neutral-surfaces`.
- No conflict resolution in
  `.claude/worktrees/generic-search-ai-enrichment-plugin` or
  `.claude/worktrees/generic-site-config-neutral-surfaces`.
- No push to `origin/generic-search-ai-enrichment-plugin` or
  `origin/generic-site-config-neutral-surfaces`.
- No queue movement or manual drain-lane creation from this handoff lane.

### Live PR state at story 003 close (unchanged heads)

| PR | Head SHA | Mergeable | Merge state | CI | Latest blocking PR conversation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #277 | `6a1530a0` | CONFLICTING | DIRTY | 11/11 SUCCESS | **BLOCKING MERGE** (2026-07-02T14:59:47Z): review clear, CI green, but `gh pr merge 277 --merge` failed — needs main merge/rebase and conflict resolution in the owned drain lane. |
| #279 | `e5defbc8` | CONFLICTING | DIRTY | 11/11 SUCCESS | **BLOCKING** (2026-07-02T13:12:04Z): local `make test` a11y timeout on `search-page-panel.a11y.test.tsx`; no later clearing comment. Also DIRTY/CONFLICTING on live GitHub. |

Batch 066 drain items remain the owners for any future branch refresh:

- `generic-search-ai-enrichment-pr277-drain` → PR #277
- `generic-site-config-pr279-drain` → PR #279

Story 004 records the exact handoff payload below.

## Story 004 — Batch 066 handoff (exact next actions)

Captured 2026-07-02T20:15Z UTC. Story 002 classified both PRs as
**handoff-to-batch-066**; story 003 did not refresh either branch. This section
is the precise payload for the existing batch 066 drain ideas. Batch 073 must
not manually move queue items or create competing drain lanes.

### Handoff routing

| Target PR | Batch 066 drain idea | Worktree | Branch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #277 | `generic-search-ai-enrichment-pr277-drain` | `.claude/worktrees/generic-search-ai-enrichment-plugin` | `generic-search-ai-enrichment-plugin` |
| #279 | `generic-site-config-pr279-drain` | `.claude/worktrees/generic-site-config-neutral-surfaces` | `generic-site-config-neutral-surfaces` |

Both drain ideas remain `idea:init` / INITIAL on trace
`trace-green-pr-drain-and-conflict-triage-batch-066` (session
`930b51a6-07ce-44e6-a639-7a6217f6e864`). Batch 066 owns review, consume, merge,
and branch-refresh completion through the established workflow.

**Latest blocking PR conversation**

- **BLOCKING MERGE** (2026-07-02T14:59:47Z): review clear and local `make test`
  passed on `6a1530a0`, CI green, but `gh pr merge 277 --merge` failed — GitHub
  cannot create a clean merge commit. No later clearing comment supersedes this
  merge blocker.
- Prior **REVIEW CLEAR** (2026-07-02T14:56:54Z) cleared earlier `make test`
  failures but does not clear the merge-conflict state.

**Recommended next action (batch 066 drain lane)**

1. Work only in
   `.claude/worktrees/generic-search-ai-enrichment-plugin` on branch
   `generic-search-ai-enrichment-plugin`.
2. `git fetch origin main` then merge or rebase `origin/main` (`77833a63`).
3. Resolve the four conflict paths above. Preserve the PR #277 search-enrichment
   boundary behavior (generic enrichment stays AI-type-free; AI facets remain on
   the Model Atlas adapter). For `search-page-panel.test.tsx`, coordinate with
   the PR #279 drain lane because both PRs conflict on that file.
4. Run `make test` locally; push refreshed head; confirm `mergeable` becomes
   `MERGEABLE` and `mergeStateStatus` becomes `CLEAN`.
5. Complete review/consume and merge through the established drain workflow once
   mergeable and local gates pass.
6. Do not add new generic shell features or touch unrelated route/sidebar/site-config
   files outside the conflict set.

**Latest blocking PR conversation**

- **BLOCKING** (2026-07-02T13:12:04Z): local `make test` failed — one a11y smoke
  test timed out at 15s:
  `src/tests/a11y/search-page-panel.a11y.test.tsx` >
  `search page panel accessibility smoke > exposes empty results to assistive
  technology with no serious axe violations`. GitHub CI was green at comment
  time; live GitHub now also reports DIRTY/CONFLICTING. No later clearing
  comment supersedes this blocker.
- Earlier merge-conflict feedback was addressed in `e5defbc8`; the a11y timeout
  is the current blocking item.

**Recommended next action (batch 066 drain lane)**

1. Work only in
   `.claude/worktrees/generic-site-config-neutral-surfaces` on branch
   `generic-site-config-neutral-surfaces`.
2. `git fetch origin main` then merge or rebase `origin/main` (`77833a63`) — the
   branch is 91 commits behind and will need a fresh conflict refresh even
   though prior merge work landed in `e5defbc8`.
3. Resolve `search-page-panel.test.tsx` with coordinated judgment against PR
   #277's drain lane (same shared conflict path).
4. Fix the local `make test` a11y timeout on
   `search-page-panel.a11y.test.tsx`; rerun full `make test` until 0 fail.
5. Push refreshed head; confirm mergeability and required checks; complete
   review/consume and merge through the established drain workflow.
6. Do not add new site-config features or touch unrelated search/sidebar/route
   files outside the conflict set.

### Cross-PR coordination note

Both drain lanes share `src/tests/search/search-page-panel.test.tsx`. Recommended
order: refresh PR #277 first (more conflict paths, search-surface owner), then
rebase/merge PR #279 against updated `origin/main` and the resolved shared test
file. Alternatively, resolve the shared test file once in one drain lane and
cherry-pick or mirror the resolution in the other — but batch 066 must keep both
drain ideas as the sole owners; this batch 073 lane does not perform the refresh.

### Batch 073 lane constraints (this handoff)

- Batch 066 owns completion for both PRs; this lane produced evidence and exact
  next actions only.
- No queue items were manually moved during story 004.
- No unrelated route, search, sidebar, site-config, or root dirty files were
  edited as part of this handoff.
- No new generic shell features were implemented.

## Evidence gathering constraints (stories 001–002)

- No git branch mutation, queue movement, staging, committing of target PR
  branches, or unrelated content editing occurred while gathering evidence.
- Only `git fetch` (read-only remote refresh) and non-mutating `git merge-tree`,
  drift queries, and `you work list` reads were used.

## Story 005 — Final verification (quality gate and non-duplication)

Captured 2026-07-02T20:45Z UTC. Confirms the narrow planner handoff outcome is
complete, non-duplicative, and passes local quality gates on this batch 073 lane.

### Selected outcome per PR (final)

| PR | Final outcome | Blocker type on target PR (unchanged; batch 066 owns fix) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #277 | **handed off to batch 066** (`generic-search-ai-enrichment-pr277-drain`) | BLOCKING MERGE — conflict drift; head `6a1530a0` unchanged |
| #279 | **handed off to batch 066** (`generic-site-config-pr279-drain`) | BLOCKING — local `make test` a11y timeout; head `e5defbc8` unchanged |

Neither PR was **refreshed** in this lane. Neither PR is **blocked with
workflow-repair** — batch 066 drain items already exist at `idea:init` and own
completion.

### Non-duplication and scope constraints (verified)

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| New generic shell features implemented | **no** — only evidence/handoff docs on this branch |
| Queue items manually moved | **no** — batch 066 drain ideas remain `idea:init` / INITIAL (re-verified 2026-07-02T20:45Z UTC) |
| Competing drain lanes created | **no** |
| Target PR branches mutated | **no** — heads `6a1530a0` (#277) and `e5defbc8` (#279) unchanged |
| Unrelated route/search/sidebar/site-config files edited | **no** |
| Root checkout dirty files unrelated to #277/#279 cleaned or modified | **no** — this lane diff is docs-only (see branch diff below) |

### Branch diff scope (this handoff lane vs `main`)

Only these files changed on `generic-pr277-pr279-conflict-refresh-handoff`:

- `docs/internal/processes/generic-pr277-pr279-conflict-refresh-handoff-relevant-files.md`
- `docs/internal/processes/factory-linkage-relevant-files.md`

No `src/` application code, search, sidebar, route, or site-config runtime files
were touched.

### Quality gate results (2026-07-02T20:45Z UTC)

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `bun run typecheck` | **pass** |
| `bun run lint` | **pass** (3 pre-existing `noNonNullAssertion` warnings in unrelated test files; 0 errors) |
| `make test` | **pass** — 3462 pass / 0 fail / 29448 expect() calls across 517 files (~1218s, 2026-07-02T18:33:48Z UTC) |

### Planner handoff summary

Batch 073 (`generic-pr277-pr279-conflict-refresh-handoff`) produced evidence and
exact next actions only. Batch 066 owns PR #277 and PR #279 refresh, conflict
resolution, local gate fixes, review/consume, and merge. See story 004 handoff
payload for numbered next actions per drain lane.
