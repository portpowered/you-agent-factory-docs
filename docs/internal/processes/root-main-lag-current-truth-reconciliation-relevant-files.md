# Root Main Lag and Current Truth Reconciliation — Relevant Files

Planner-truth reconciliation after the root checkout was clean but 17 commits
behind `origin/main` at `2026-07-02T19:01Z`. Do not treat the stale row as
current truth. This lane is read-first: capture live git truth before any sync,
note update, or no-update outcome.

## Core handoff module

* `src/lib/factory/planner-root-main-lag-current-truth-reconciliation.ts` —
  read-only root git truth capture plus queue/planner-report comparison against
  live git. Story 001 captures worktree cleanliness, `HEAD` and
  `origin/main` commit identities, and relationship (`aligned`, `ahead`,
  `behind`, `diverged`, `unknown`). Story 002 compares queue JSON and default
  planner report markdown against that git truth without running the factory
  runtime. Story 003 chooses and optionally applies the smallest safe outcome:
  root fast-forward sync, stale-state note update, or explicit no-update reason.
* `src/lib/factory/planner-root-main-lag-current-truth-reconciliation.test.ts` —
  fixture git repo tests for clean/aligned, behind, dirty, diverged,
  non-destructive git usage, queue/planner-note alignment, and outcome apply
  paths.
* `scripts/report-planner-root-main-lag-current-truth-reconciliation.ts` —
  planner-facing CLI with `--repo-root`, `--remote-base-ref`,
  `--status-output`, `--work-list-json`, repeated `--planner-report`,
  `--generated-at-utc`, `--apply`, and `--json` / `--format json`. Does not
  invoke `you`.

## Upstream evidence reuse

* `src/lib/factory/planner-root-checkout-reconciliation.ts` — `detectDefaultRemoteBaseRef`
* `src/lib/factory/planner-worktree-drift-watchdog.ts` — `parsePlannerRelevantDirtyPaths`
* `src/lib/factory/active-pr-mergeability-watchdog.ts` — `classifyBranchDrift` for
  `origin/main...HEAD` rev-list counts

## Planner-facing command

| When | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Capture current root vs `origin/main` git truth (story 001) | `bun run report:planner-root-main-lag-current-truth-reconciliation` |
| Compare queue state and default planner reports (story 002) | `bun run report:planner-root-main-lag-current-truth-reconciliation -- --work-list-json /path/to/work-list.json` |
| Point at the planner root checkout explicitly | `bun run report:planner-root-main-lag-current-truth-reconciliation -- --repo-root /path/to/root` |
| Decide and apply the smallest safe outcome (story 003) | `bun run report:planner-root-main-lag-current-truth-reconciliation -- --repo-root /path/to/root --apply --planner-report docs/internal/processes/root-main-lag-current-truth-reconciliation-relevant-files.md` |
| Override planner report inputs | `bun run report:planner-root-main-lag-current-truth-reconciliation -- --planner-report docs/internal/processes/root-main-lag-current-truth-reconciliation-relevant-files.md` |

## Fixture-backed verification

Fixtures live under
`src/tests/fixtures/planner-root-main-lag-current-truth-reconciliation/`:

* `stale-current-lag-work-list.json` — queue record still claims current 17-commit lag
* `historical-lag-work-list.json` — queue record preserves the stale observation as historical
* `stale-current-lag-planner-report.md` — planner report with present-tense lag claim
* `historical-lag-planner-report.md` — planner report with historical stale observation framing

## Stale observation reference

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Stale observation time | `2026-07-02T19:01Z` |
| Reported lag | 17 commits behind `origin/main` |
| Constants | `ROOT_MAIN_LAG_STALE_OBSERVATION_UTC`, `ROOT_MAIN_LAG_STALE_COMMIT_COUNT` |

Story 002 classifies planner-facing notes as `stale-root-lag-reference`,
`already-resolved-condition`, or `conflicting-current-condition` against live git
truth from story 001. Do not treat the stale row as current truth.

## Current truth resolution

<!-- ROOT_MAIN_LAG_CURRENT_TRUTH_RESOLUTION:START -->

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Resolved at UTC | 2026-07-02T21:00:00.000Z |
| Outcome kind | explicit-no-update |
| Root HEAD | a502405 (a502405d49badc50b8b3c0ea49cd8d35a402738e) |
| Remote base | origin/main a502405 |
| Relationship | aligned |
| Worktree | clean |
| No-update reason | root already reflects current truth |
| Stale notes retired | stale 2026-07-02T19:01Z 17-commit lag observation |
| Operational summary | Root is clean and aligned with origin/main; no git update is needed. The stale 2026-07-02T19:01Z lag should be treated as historical context. |
| Planner artifact | `docs/internal/processes/root-main-lag-current-truth-reconciliation-relevant-files.md` (this file) |
| Verification command | `bun run report:planner-root-main-lag-current-truth-reconciliation -- --repo-root <root> --apply --planner-report docs/internal/processes/root-main-lag-current-truth-reconciliation-relevant-files.md` |
| User work reverted | no |
| Post-outcome relationship | aligned (clean worktree) |

<!-- ROOT_MAIN_LAG_CURRENT_TRUTH_RESOLUTION:END -->

## Verification evidence

Future planners should read the **Current truth resolution** table above and
re-run the verification command against the planner root checkout
(`--repo-root` pointing at the root worktree, not this factory worktree).

| Check | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| User work preserved | Resolution table shows `User work reverted = no` |
| Post-outcome git truth | `Relationship` and `Worktree` rows match live `git status` and `origin/main...HEAD` |
| Planner artifact | This file remains the canonical handoff; do not rely on the stale `2026-07-02T19:01Z` lag row |
| Content-page boundary | This lane must not edit `src/content/**` page bundles |

## Boundaries

* Do not run the factory runtime (`you`).
* Do not edit content pages.
* Do not revert, reset, or fast-forward the root during story 001–002 capture.
* Story 003 may fast-forward a clean behind root or update this planner report
  when `--apply` is passed; preserve dirty or diverged user work.
* Story 004 adds scope boundaries, verification evidence, and formatted handoff
  fields proving no user work was reverted and identifying dirty state that
  blocked root sync.
