# Canonical Page Surface Budget Relevant Files

Use this reference when reviewing or authoring routine canonical-page pull
requests. The budget keeps ordinary page work narrow so parallel page lanes
do not collide on shared runtime, helper, and verification surfaces.

## Observable budget categories

The routine canonical-page PR budget classifies changed paths into four
practical buckets. These are the same categories used by
`bun run audit:canonical-page-surface`.

| Category | Observable meaning | Routine page work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Page-owned** | One page bundle under `src/content/docs/<section>/<slug>/` (`page.mdx`, `messages/en.json`, `assets.json`, page-local media), the matching primary registry record at `src/content/registry/<kind>/<slug>.json`, and page-specific supporting graph/table/citation records declared by that bundle | Expected default |
| **Supported derived** | Artifacts recreated by supported commands such as `bun run prepare:content-runtime` (for example `src/lib/content/generated/*.generated.ts`) | Regenerate locally; do not commit generated runtime artifacts in the routine review commit unless the work item is explicitly broader |
| **Shared hotspot** | Shared helpers (`src/lib/content`, `src/lib/search`), shared test and verification files (`src/lib/content/*.test.ts`, `src/tests/ci`, `scripts/validate-*.ts`), broad registry or manifest edits beyond the page's primary record, build or tooling files | Avoid in ordinary page work; treat as exception or redirect |
| **Unknown / broader** | Paths outside the owned page scope that do not fit the three lanes above | Requires human review; usually signals a throughput lane rather than routine page generation |

This document stays focused on routine canonical-page behavior. It is not a full
repository inventory.

## Page-owned surfaces (routine default)

For one canonical page, reviewers should expect:

- The page bundle directory and its colocated files
- The matching primary structured registry record for that page
- Page-specific supporting records (graph, table, citation, or paper records
  that exist only to render that same page)
- No unrelated shared-surface churn

## Shared hotspot surfaces (high risk for ordinary page work)

Ordinary page branches should avoid touching:

- **`src/lib/content`** — content runtime helpers, MDX components, generated
  runtime manifests, and colocated content tests
- **Shared test and verification files** — `src/lib/content/*.test.ts`,
  `src/tests/ci`, `src/tests/search`, and `scripts/validate-*.ts`
- **Shared registry or manifest sweeps** — broad edits under
  `src/content/registry/` beyond the page's own primary record
- **Build, search, factory, or repository tooling** — unless the work item is
  explicitly broader than one page

## Current hotspot evidence

Maintained evidence comes from `bun run report:planner-conflict-hotspots`. The
report samples recent commits and ranks collision-prone surfaces by touch count.

In the current snapshot, **shared content runtime and verification surfaces are
hotter than individual authored page bundles**:

- `src/lib/content` under **shared test/verification** often leads the ranked
  surfaces (for example 30+ touches across many paths in a 40-commit sample)
- A single page bundle under `src/content/docs/<section>/<slug>/` typically
  appears with only a handful of touches (often 3–4 per bundle in the same
  sample)
- Generated runtime artifacts under `src/lib/content/generated/` also recur as
  **shared hotspot** churn separate from the authored page bundle

Re-run the hotspot report locally when evidence ages. The audit command reads
the same snapshot contract when classifying branch diffs.

When maintained hotspot evidence cannot be collected (for example outside a git
checkout), the audit falls back to static path classification and prints an
explicit **Fallback mode** section with the collection error. Path categories
still apply, but ranked touch-count evidence is omitted until
`report:planner-conflict-hotspots` succeeds again.

Over-budget output groups shared paths into reviewer-readable buckets:

- **Content runtime and helper surfaces** — `shared-helper`, `shared-registry`,
  and `authored-content` touches such as `src/lib/content`
- **Shared test and verification surfaces** — `shared-test` touches such as
  `src/tests/ci` and `scripts/validate-*.ts`

## Three review lanes

| Lane | When it applies | Contributor action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Default pass (`keep-routine`)** | Only page-owned paths changed | Open or update the routine page PR; no extra justification |
| **Narrow exception (`declare-exception`)** | One small shared hotspot touch directly required to ship the page | Rerun the audit with `--exception-reason "..."` and repeat the same justification in the PR conversation comment |
| **Split or redirect** | Generated outputs in the review commit (`split-to-page-owned-work`), multiple shared categories, shared test churn, or broad helper/runtime edits (`redirect-to-throughput-prd`) | Remove generated artifacts from the routine commit, split page-owned work from shared changes, or open a dedicated throughput/conflict-reduction PRD lane |

## Local checker

| When | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Classify the current branch diff | `bun run audit:canonical-page-surface -- --page-dir src/content/docs/<section>/<slug>` |
| Classify the branch diff against a specific base ref | `bun run audit:canonical-page-surface -- --page-dir src/content/docs/<section>/<slug> --base origin/main` |
| Classify an explicit path list | `bun run audit:canonical-page-surface -- --page-dir src/content/docs/<section>/<slug> --files <path...>` |
| Refresh maintained hotspot evidence | `bun run report:planner-conflict-hotspots` |
| Declare a visible shared-surface exception | `bun run audit:canonical-page-surface -- --page-dir ... --exception-reason "<why>"` |

### Classifier output kinds

The checker maps each changed path to one observable kind. These align with the
budget buckets above:

| Checker kind | Budget bucket | Example output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `page-owned` | Page-owned | `page.mdx -> page-owned (matching page bundle)` |
| `declared-generated-output` | Supported derived | `runtime.generated.ts -> declared generated output` |
| `shared-hotspot-surface` | Shared hotspot (or unknown/broader when the path is outside page scope) | `slug-utils.ts -> shared hotspot surface [shared helper]` |

In-budget page-only work prints `Budget status: within-budget` with
`Recommended action: keep-routine`. Over-budget work names each offending path,
its category label, and the next review lane.

### Over-budget and exception output

The checker never silently converts shared-hotspot churn into routine page work.
Reviewers can distinguish a clean in-budget pass from an exception lane or a
redirect lane by these observable markers:

| Marker | In-budget pass | Narrow exception | Split or redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Budget status` | `within-budget` | `over-budget` | `over-budget` |
| `Recommended action` | `keep-routine` | `declare-exception` | `split-to-page-owned-work` or `redirect-to-throughput-prd` |
| `Visible exception` line | absent | present when `--exception-reason` is supplied | present only when declared; redirect lane may still reject the exception |
| Offending path lines | none | `-> shared hotspot surface [category]` for each shared path | same, plus generated-output lines when applicable |
| Guidance headline | routine page-owned wording | narrow exception wording | split-back or redirect wording |

Representative over-budget output always names the specific offending paths and
their categories under **Changed path classifications**, then groups shared
paths under **Shared hotspot summary** buckets. The **Guidance** section states
the recommended next action in contributor terms:

- **Split page-owned work** (`split-to-page-owned-work`) — remove generated
  runtime artifacts from the routine review commit and keep only page-owned
  paths.
- **Justify the exception** (`declare-exception`) — rerun with
  `--exception-reason "..."` and repeat the same justification in the PR
  conversation comment when one narrow shared touch is truly required.
- **Move to a broader item** (`redirect-to-throughput-prd`) — split shared
  helper, shared test, or multi-page churn into a dedicated throughput or
  conflict-reduction lane.

## Behavioral verification

Focused representative coverage lives in
`src/tests/ci/canonical-page-surface-audit-behavioral-verification.test.ts`.
The suite uses temporary fixture repos (no real page payloads) and asserts
observable CLI outcomes for:

- a representative page-only path set that passes as in budget via `--files`
- a representative shared-surface path set that is over budget with actionable
  guidance via `--files`
- explicit path-list input that classifies independently from git branch diff

Unit and command tests in `canonical-page-surface-audit.test.ts` and
`canonical-page-surface-audit-command.test.ts` cover exception lanes, hotspot
evidence fallback, and branch-diff classification.
