1. good code reduces state persistence, it attempts to reduce functions as simple referentially transparent functions and maintains state only at the edges whenever possible. 
2. good code reduces logical complexity. it attempts to shrink complex duplication into simplified concepts as the code changes over time. 
3. good code is well tested, it evaluates and conforms to the appropriate shapes across failures, various forms of state, etc.
4. good form leads, it defines acceptable states and precludes non acceptable states from appearing. 
5. good code is obvious, it does not hide things but makes it perfrom without surprise. 

## Shared content path helpers

Routine canonical docs page additions should not add page-specific directory
exports to `src/lib/content/content-paths.ts`. Compute page directories with
`getDocsPageDir(section, slug)` and keep shared roots (`getDocsRoot`,
`getRegistryRoot`, `getMessagesRoot`) and section roots (`getDocsSectionRoot`,
`get*DocsRoot`) for tree-wide or section-wide work. See
[content-page-generation-workflow-relevant-files](./internal/processes/content-page-generation-workflow-relevant-files.md).

## Routine page PR scope

Ordinary canonical page branches should stay page-local unless the requested
behavior requires shared infrastructure changes. Do not hide shared helper,
generated artifact, shared test, broad validator, or registry-manifest churn
inside a routine page slice—redirect shared hotspot work to a broader
throughput/conflict-reduction PRD. See
[CONTRIBUTING — routine canonical-page PR surface budget](./contributors/CONTRIBUTING.md#routine-canonical-page-pr-surface-budget).
